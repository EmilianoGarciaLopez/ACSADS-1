I only understand the lyrics to english songs like half the time so I dont see a problem That said there is an added dimension to enjoyment if you know the words to a song
Im also kind of confused why dame is ranked so high
Heard a reporter saying there was a mix of people preaching to keep it peaceful and another group calling to storm the building Unfortunately the bad apples are the ones who will get the most coverage
People on the far left fail to understand the universality of what they are recklessly preaching Once you accept the precedent that something is okay to oppress you open the door to something far worse
Trump I dont know anything about QANON so I wont condemn them Ill also retweet this story about SEAL Team Six faking Osama bin Ladens death to which I know nothing about
Anyone who must say Im the president is no true president
Yea do they have the concrete proof that votes are illegitimate If so whats the actual path for retroactively discounting those ballots and what is the exact criteria for those that have been proven fraud More importantly would the rest of the country stand for that if it wasnt made irrevocably and transparently clear that fraud has occurred
Agree with your sentiment but I do think in this case someone upstairs intentionally let all this play out the way it did Just from comparing the apparent security today to a few months ago 
He was trying to get him to shake his hand to signify the game was over
Lol dude he didnt even say anything offensive Hes just not jizzing his pants over Lukas game winner Somehow that makes him a pariah
Twitter is setting a bad example with this move If leaking illegal information will get you blocked what happens to whistleblowers Not to mention the utter hypocrisy in them targeting the Hunter Biden story What about Trumps tax return Was that information legally obtained if not why werent links to that blocked
Question but if there was widespread fraud going on with mailin ballots why would it only be used as a tool by the left If it is easily exploitable I can see both sides committing fraudTrump has been pushing a narrative that it has been a large scale coordinated attack by the Dems but if that were the case they still lost a bunch of Congress seatsIf youre going to go so far as to rig an election why only rig the president and lose the senate It makes little sense to me
Its not Also what are you implying Is this post so controversial to you

Spongebob after season 3 is hella obnoxious but the early seasons are still hella funny as an adult
We cant remove racism by creating a victimabuser paradigm based on race This is a ridiculous thing for the university to advocate
Its just so pandering and selfmasturbatory now They dont cant take risks or try to be edgy because they want to convey they are on the side of cultural sensitivity and any political material they do have is just a soap box for leftist ideology
It is definitely prerecorded Kinda disingenuous that these tapings that have clearly been messed with post production keep getting referred to as performances but whatever

Thats funny about St Vincent as I think she has actually won a Grammy for best packaging

This is one of the most unreasonable threads Ive ever seen Not you OP the comments Even if you factor out the parents you paid off a shit load of debt on a yearly pretty low income You did literally every step personal finance recommends and they are attacking you for it You got outside help when you could you stayed at home actually a lot less than you should have 3 months after college is somehow unreasonable now You negotiated pay raises and changed jobs as needed You made a proper budget You cut every corner you reasonably could The problem these people have You didnt make excuses and used every advantage you possibly could Your advantages were less than your average redditor Think about it The average US redditor is a college aged white kid from New York or California according to reddits own data These are opulent areas and its very safe to assume they have parental help likely much more so than yours as they are in insanely over priced areas The jealousy in this thread is intense What you did is a prime example of what everyone should do in this situation The difference You actually did it intelligently

Hey liberals Thanks for the dozens of reports to this post Im not removing it GFY Love Jibrish Some highlights If you voted Trump then youre the problem You won because of voter suppression in swing states Shut up bigots Trump is a racist misogynistic ass we have him literally on tape saying these things You won because of false advertising Enjoy the next four years because its all youll get

 As of today the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit Reddit actually did something Amazing Now donate to charities to help prevent this shit Maybe something to act as watchdogs for this
Competition is great when its your company vs another It tends to backfire when the guy you want to beat is on the same team What they confuse is a friendly rivalry which is usually great with internal competition which is fucking awful

Thats a quarter pounder woth thighs
Reminder that beoyonce released an album called black is King and Nick Cannon said that white people are animals And Taylor Swift released a sexist music video where she dressed up like a man and played into every single sexist antiman stereotype of men that she could and all of those are okay because its either against white people or against men Because thats what happens in a black supremacist matriarchy Outright hatred of the nonruling class is fine but even the slightest perception of disrespect towards the rulin is treated with whats essentially lynchings
Basically they are disguising black Supremacy as fighting racism And as always conservatives are illequipped to actually fight that battle

Ive literally never understood this outside of just antisemitism I mean its not like they have any evidence to back up their claim Its not like theres anything that could even lead a reasonable investigative person to even come close to that kind of conclusion Theres literally just no evidence for blaming them for every single one of your problems and yet these people manage to blame them for every single one of their problems
liberals literally believe that black people are genetically worse than white people To the point that they believe that math classes that white people can pass are too difficult for black people to pass That training and requiring work ethic is something that black people cant accomplis and of course the triedandtrue black people are too stupid to figure out how to get an i d like every other race

It actually depends on the administration If Facility and staff respect them they have significantly more power especially the Executive Branch Soft Power is still power They often cant directly change anything but if UH Admin consults them and take their opinions seriously they can make a huge impact In a rare instance they will actually have direct impact on campus too SGA also appointments people too FSAC or some acronym like that that have a direct impact on budgets from student fee funded orgs around campus I hope Im remembering all that correctly

And yet we also know that our experience of high school is often entirely different from what we see onscreen Teenage characters regularly wear incredibly expensive fashionforward outfits have impressively full social lives seem to never have any schoolwork and magically get into IvyLeague colleges without working that hard In short high school onscreen and high school offscreen have very little in common This may be true but to say kids arent having sex is ridiculous

It seems to me that everything posted related to the state of fear the democrats are promoting gets brigaded and kept at or below 0 internet points All of the major talking points are fear based Climate is an existential crisis history and statues are an existential crisis Trump is an existential crisis Covid is an existential crisis This is one of if not the best time to be alive in the history of humanity Everything the democrats are pushing for is based on fear tactics that only serve to erode our basic liberties guaranteed by the constitution Recent rulings by State Supreme Courts show this to be true regarding some of the draconian lockdown mandates If you look past the fear theyve got nothing left Thats my two cents
Meh pretend internet points give them kicks
Why hasnt Joe been asked to denounce this 150 times a day

Some people here seem to be perfectly ok with the old saying of fighting fire with fire If that means defying the constitution then theyre ok with it Thats not ok Some people take that as siding with the enemy
Ive been saying this for weeks while everyone on here twitter and Facebook have been saying he can do this The constitution is very clear
Its not looking good at this point Edit stop awarding this post This isnt really good news Edit2 clearly the leftists didnt catch the reverse psychology in my above statement Imagine wasting money rewarding this post and brigading like yall are The party of clowns are the ones brigading right now Reporting this post like Im suicidal sending me hateful DMs yea and yall wonder why you cant be taken seriously
Instead of talking about it show it and present a case Im tried of the talk Unless its proven and documented its going to continue to be labeled a conspiracy
Its not can be useful for home defense They ARE useful for home defense
I personally love how they specify race in this article like race really matters with self defense
Exactly Just look at the flared individuals here commenting who are willing to defy the constitution in the name of winning Thats not how it works at all
Normally functioning human beings regardless of political affiliation can see that Unfortunately the young generation left becomes unhinged when they dont get their way This includes assault and attempted murder of someone whos armed without consequences They want no one to be armed so they can do what they want in mob format
Rightfully so This is long overdue at this point but right decision nonetheless
Exactly my point Im tired of seeing people try to fight crazy with crazy Until we start holding our own accountable well always end up in this perpetual downfall of looking like a party of Alex Jones clones I refuse to be associated with people like that Theyre not conservatives theyre nutcases

Bxf14 is by far the best move for LibRight It forces LibLeft to take with their king and give up castling rights They will be left with a permanently crippled position and have a hard time activating their rook You might be thinking cant LibLeft just take with the rook Heres why that wouldnt be all that good Taking with the rook is actually worse because it that creates a weak d13 AND e13 pawn which can now be targets for AuthLeft and LibRight AuthLeft can play c10 which immediately attacks the e pawn and pins it to the rook forcing LibLeft to play Re14 to guard the pawn This is just suboptimal as it loses a tempo and helps AuthLeft develop their pieces Source I have no life and play 10s of hours of chess every week
The pawn moves are actually not all that bad In four person chess youre better off playing in a more defensive hypermodern style and using the scope of the bishops to control the board LibLeft and Authleft are playing what in normal chess would be called the Vant Krujis Opening assuming they are playing as white As black this would be the English defense It was named after a Dutch player Maarten vant Kruijs who was the Dutch chess champion back in 1878 This opening is extremely rare in high level chess and not all that great for white normally However in this variant of chess its a useful move to play in the more hypermodern style of chess by fianchettoing the bishops and playing slow pawn moves to eventually lash out in the center once your pieces are developed Pushing the king pawn two squares also immediately creates a piece that can become a target for the other players since its no longer protected Anyway the idea would be to play something like m10 and fianchetto the bishop And then you can develop your knights and castle long or short Pretty decent way to play probably not the best but its definitely not wrong or anything TLDR bishops go brrr ps Im sorry you had to read all this Im baked as fuck

So Ive made it my mission in life to rob every single one of mr keks stores I come across ever since he fucked me up as a 9 years old playing this game Its a pretty good money making scheme too if you pull it off right but for me its personal Things you need XRay specs useful for finding where the shops are Mobile Scarf I use this to hide in the walls so mr kek cant touch me Pikachu I personally like Pikachu because for dungeon exploration solo this thing is great agility makes it easier to run from mr kek since hes permenantly at x2 speed Also it gets the stair sensor IQ skill which makes it a bit easier to locate the stairs room so you can get out of there asap Crap ton of Gold RibbonsLost Loot Anyway onto the steps 1 Go to marine resort after equipping xray specs 2 Keep climbing levels till you find a kek shop 3 Once you find a kek store also locate where the stairs are 4 Now clear the kek shop of any items and place down your gold ribbonslost loot 5 Sell them to mr kek and then pick them back up 6 Equip your mobile scarf 7 Agility 4 times till youre at quadruple speed 8 Yeet into the walls and make a beeline for the stairs room Agility as needed if youre out of the walls and a kek comes near Because of how movement works in this game as long as you stay a level above the kek they wont even ever get to move 9 Profit Yes you can use a pure seed as well but theres no reliable way to farm them so I prefer this method Twarl orbs are a bit more risky since mr kek will fuck you up if one spawns in the room while youre picking up the items

This whole comment reeks of victim blaming The equivalent would be telling this to a woman whos talking about her rape story I dont mean to insult you at all but whats the common denominator I and all my male friends know tons of women none of whom have been sexually assaulted or raped How is it that youve experienced this specific circumstance twice while no one I know has experienced it once Do you frequently wear short skirts out in public Are you the type who goes out partying and drinking Do you often sleep with men who are likely to commit domestic violence andor rape Im really not sure what questions to ask but the fact that this has happened to you twice makes me think that your behavior is at least part of the problem Why is your immediate response to blame the dude and imply that its his fault in some way instead of empathizing with him and blaming the person who committed the immoral and illegal action
thats a massive load of shit you just pulled out of your ass there

For those unaware here is why rConservative went private  Reddit has since terminated the employee However given the extremely delayed response and honestly relatively poor handling of this situation we arent entirely impressed Were not about waiting for others to fix the problem for us though so we have decided to do something about it Weve started a fundraiser for a great charity dedicated to preventing child abuse the PCAA Prevent Child Abuse America While the subreddit was private we managed to raise over 5000 10000 for this charity But we can do more Join your fellow rConservative posters and friends Even lefties this had bipartisan support in donating a couple bucks to help out a great cause This was organized on our discord in only a few short hours and we are already over 5000 in donations from just the discord alone  Thank you to everyone who has donated so far To anyone who cant afford to donate please spread the word about this charity You can read more about the charity here

Even the NYTimes profile on her was mostly positive of her with a few potshots here and there x200B Legal scholars said Judge Barretts opinions on the appeals court have been models of judicial craftsmanship tightly reasoned and unflashy Her conservatism is embedded in her methodological and jurisprudential commitments not any commitment to a particular policy outcome said Jonathan H Adler a law professor at Case Western Reserve University As a scholar and a judge she has shown herself to be a very careful and deliberate thinker who is concerned with getting the right answer whether or not its the popular answer x200B Still those who know Judge Barrett say she is not ideological in her writings Every Notre Dame Law School faculty member supported her elevation to the appellate court noting they did so in spite of their different political persuasions One of her former students said that in class she would not have known Ms Barrett was Catholic and that she did not start class with prayer or the sign of the cross like other professors at Notre Dame x200B Peers describe her as a textualist like Justice Scalia one who interprets the law based on its plain words as opposed to someone who looks to accomplish the legislatures purpose And they said she was an originalist meaning a judge who interprets the Constitution according to the understanding of those who drafted and ratified it Justice Kennedy showed a willingness to interpolate things into the Constitution that in cases like Obergefell that Justice Scalia for example would not have done said John Garvey the president of the Catholic University of America who taught Judge Barrett in law school referring to the 2015 decision that established a constitutional right to samesex marriage My guess is that Judge Barrett wouldnt assume that the judicial role carried that much power with it x200B In a 2017 law review article written before she joined the appeals court Judge Barrett was critical of Chief Justice John G Roberts Jrs 2012 opinion sustaining a central provision of the Affordable Care Act saying he had betrayed the commands of textualism Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute she wrote x200B In the world of conservative judges she has particularly strong credentials Judge Barrett began clerking for Justice Antonin Scalia 22 years ago and her fellow clerks are quick to say she was his favorite She graduated summa cum laude from Notre Dame Law School and joined the faculty in 2002 earning praise from colleagues as an astute scholar and jurist even if they did not always agree on her jurisprudential premises

False accusations become a lot worse when people take false accusations to court and sometimes can even someone falsely imprisoned or sentenced At that point if the fact the accusation is false can be proven I do genuinely think the punishment should be the same as the punishment for the rape because theyre trying to wrongfully give that exact punishment to another person

Some people here seem to be perfectly ok with the old saying of fighting fire with fire If that means defying the constitution then theyre ok with it Thats not ok Some people take that as siding with the enemy
Ive been saying this for weeks while everyone on here twitter and Facebook have been saying he can do this The constitution is very clear
Its not looking good at this point Edit stop awarding this post This isnt really good news Edit2 clearly the leftists didnt catch the reverse psychology in my above statement Imagine wasting money rewarding this post and brigading like yall are The party of clowns are the ones brigading right now Reporting this post like Im suicidal sending me hateful DMs yea and yall wonder why you cant be taken seriously
Instead of talking about it show it and present a case Im tried of the talk Unless its proven and documented its going to continue to be labeled a conspiracy
Its not can be useful for home defense They ARE useful for home defense
I personally love how they specify race in this article like race really matters with self defense
Exactly Just look at the flared individuals here commenting who are willing to defy the constitution in the name of winning Thats not how it works at all
Normally functioning human beings regardless of political affiliation can see that Unfortunately the young generation left becomes unhinged when they dont get their way This includes assault and attempted murder of someone whos armed without consequences They want no one to be armed so they can do what they want in mob format
Rightfully so This is long overdue at this point but right decision nonetheless
Exactly my point Im tired of seeing people try to fight crazy with crazy Until we start holding our own accountable well always end up in this perpetual downfall of looking like a party of Alex Jones clones I refuse to be associated with people like that Theyre not conservatives theyre nutcases
This needs to be known more universally People fail to understand that but they tossed the race card when he banned travel They also tried to make excuses saying he didnt really know there was anything going on after it came out as an emergency
Somehow I doubt he even knows how to play chess set all Hes proven to everyone that hes been losing 4D chess for years now
The dude is a lunatic Edit For the individuals unflaired that are commenting I see the notifications Using freedom of speech as an excuse to call for the execution of someone is a lame excuse Have better morals than that

A 63 increase in gasoline prices in the past year while Joe Biden suspends drilling and cancels pipelines
The media is irresponsible for doing so If it turns out Trump won because of fraud or a voting machine glitch the proBiden people will go nuts
 The uncertainty ranges do not overlap thus confirming that pipelines have lower GHG emissions which is important information for policy makers conducting pipeline reviews
 The recent report that the Biden administration is considering restricting the travel of Floridians is completely absurd especially when Biden allows illegal aliens to pour across our southern border he said

The New York Times published a distorted and factually incorrect story on the front page of the Sunday November 17 edition concerning FedEx and our billions of dollars of tax payments and billions of dollars of investments in the US economy Pertinent to this outrageous distortion of the truth is the fact that unlike FedEx the New York Times paid zero federal income tax in 2017 on earnings of 111 million Edit NY Times response to FedEX FedExs colorful response does not actually challenge a single fact in our story Were confident in the accuracy of our reporting Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha said in a statement FedExs invitation is clearly a stunt and an effort to distract from the findings of our story It is worth noting that the Times did not appear to dispute the allegations from Smith that the newspaper did not pay any federal income taxes in 2017 on earnings of 111 million

No The GOP needs lawmakers to actually stick to the platform The platform from 2016 is here  Edit for those asking Its a link to a pdf on the page Heres a key piece Reducing the Federal Debt Our national debt is a burden on our economy and families The huge increase in the national debt demanded by and incurred during the current Administration has placed a significant burden on future generations We must impose firm caps on future debt accelerate the repayment of the trillions we now owe in order to reaffirm our principles of responsible and limited government and remove the burdens we are placing on future generations A strong economy is one key to debt reduction but spending restraint is a necessary component that must be vigorously pursued

Once a dictator has committed serious human rights violations the only way for them to avoid prosecution by their own people or international courts is to remain in power That also applies to those around the leader Thus there is no limit to the horror of what may go on within that power structure
When California public health officials announced guidelines for reopening theme parks that essentially guarantee that parks in Los Angeles Orange and San Diego counties wont be able to open until perhaps mid2021 heads of the respective theme parks rightfully blasted Gavin Newsom citing their successes in reopening in other states and countries and alleging that his guidelines have no scientific basis Yes

The objective of the Chinese communist government is to become the preeminent superpower on the face of the Earth the preeminent military power the preeminent economic power and to dictate its will across the globe I believe China poses the most significant geopolitical threat for the United States over the next century because its ambitions are unlimited and its record of torture murder lies and oppression would only grow worse were China to achieve its objective of global superiority In practice communism is about power domination and almost inevitably it has resulted in poverty and misery The Chinese Communist Party desires to exercise complete control over the Chinese citizenry their speech their religion their economic activities and over everything they say do or think every minute of the day With technology that specter is becoming more and more of a reality Communist governments consistently engage in massive surveillance of their citizens to brutally punish and eliminate the sense Xi Jinping is quite content to be an absolute dictator Nails it

If a female on the left stands up and defies Trump they are praised by the MSM as a powerful feminist fighting against sexism I wonder why that isnt true for Republican females
Hopefully my state of California loses a few as well
Does it surprise anyone that theyre literally celebrating this over at rpolitics
Their goal is to become the predominant super power in the world while a majority of our politicians only care about virtue signaling of course that seems laughable to them

Even though there were two types of prototypes Googles focus was on the Blackberry like phone before the iPhone announcement The touchscreen phone was in early stages of development From an excerpt of the book published in The Atlantic Chris DeSalvos reaction to the iPhone was immediate and visceral As a consumer I was blown away I wanted one immediately But as a Google engineer I thought Were going to have to start over What we had suddenly looked just so nineties DeSalvo said Its just one of those things that are obvious when you see it Former Android chief Andy Rubins reaction to the iPhone keynote was similar Rubin was so astonished by what Jobs was unveiling that on his way to a meeting he had his driver pull over so that he could finish watching the webcast Holy crap he said to one of his colleagues in the car I guess were not going to ship that phone 
When Pelosi spoke at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday she never mentioned Trumps impeachment She didnt mention Ukraine or Russia or any of the other reasons Democrats spent three years arguing were grounds for his removal from office No other House member who voted to impeach Trump and no senator who found him guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors mentioned his impeachment Nor did Barack Obama or Michael Bloomberg who paid for ads in 27 states in January calling for Trumps removal Nor did the hosts Nor did Joe Biden In fact we reviewed transcripts of the entire four days and the word impeach was never uttered once NOT EVEN ONCE
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
The main thing that I want to get out there is that I want little white kids to know that they are not oppressors I want little black kids to know that they are not oppressed And they can do anything that they want to do anything they put their mind to They can overcome any obstacle your skin color does not matter This video warms my heart and it gives me hope

Gender is objective Its not a mood Its not a feeling Its genetic binary and definite Youre either a boy or a girl period Efforts to deny biology aside the vast majority of the world still recognizes male and female when they see it Crossdressing is weird and you can expect people to react accordingly If the mere presence of these words on your screen triggers you you may be a liberal
 The mikeroweWORKS Foundation is a 501c3 public charity that rewards people with a passion to get trained for skilled jobs that actually exist As CEO of the Foundation Mike Rowe spends a significant amount of time speaking about the countrys dysfunctional relationship with work highlighting the widening skills gap and challenging the persistent belief that a fouryear degree is automatically the best path for the most people Through its scholarship programs including the Work Ethic Scholarship Program the Foundation provides financial assistance to qualified individuals with a desire to learn a skill that is in demand The Foundation has been instrumental in granting more than 3 million in education for trade schools across the country 
I find it biologically and statistically improbable that all of these people born at around the same time were actually born in the wrong body I find it strange that they think they need hormones and surgery that will sterilize them permanently What seems obvious to me is that they are uncomfortable with their bodies suffer from other issues like anxiety and depression and see the attention and attractiveness of transition as a way out She is living through all this on campus and has come to a very reasonable conclusion What I dont understand is why all of my friends act like this is normal Am I really the only one who has concerns Or is everyone as scared as I am to say something She is not alone

Cognitive dissonance is the term psychologists use to describe the mental debility that occurs when a person simultaneously holds two contradictory beliefs Unfortunately the Trump administrations efforts to secure our borders and enforce immigration law seem to have generated a significant amount of cognitive dissonance particularly among open borders advocates and the media Heres a by no means exhaustive list of some of the mass migration arguments that rest on internal contradictions Its not fair to uproot illegal alien children and send them to a country they know nothing about Then by definition the parents of these illegal alien children were patently unfair when they first brought their kids to the United States a country that they knew nothing about None of the proponents of this argument ever seem able to explain why enforcing immigration law creates a moral and ethical dilemma but violating it doesnt Youre separating families Every day in the United States our courts send people with families to prison because they broke the law Those people are separated from their families sometimes for life Yet no one ever advances the argument that we shouldnt jail burglars fraudsters or other lawbreakers because theyll be separated from their kin It is a generally accepted principle that decisions to violate the law carry consequences How is immigration law any different It is illogical to argue that when immigrants consciously decide to separate their families in order to come to the United States thats okay but that when the United States enforces immigration laws the separation of families is immoral It is also illogical to argue that the mere existence of innocent family members erases the illegal aliens violation No one gets a pass on drunk driving simply because the car was full of sober passengers So many illegal aliens have been here so long they have deep roots it wouldnt be right to send them away In no other area of the law does anyone argue that evading the police and continuously violating the law is a mitigating circumstance In fact its usually considered an aggravating factor that results in a stiffer sentence Yet open borders advocates consistently argue that the longer illegal aliens violate the law the more lenient we should be with them Thats a losing argument As every parent and elementary school teacher knows rewarding bad behavior simply leads to more bad behavior Sure illegal aliens broke immigration laws but theyre obeying all of the other laws Typically this is true of most people who perpetrate lowlevel crimes But no one claims we shouldnt punish tax evaders because theyre not murderers It is what illegal aliens have done violating the Immigration and Nationality Act that should concern us not what they didnt do The bulk of the American people experience no cognitive dissonance when it comes to immigration They understand that laws are enacted to protect public safety and national security Therefore engaging in mental gymnastics to avoid holding violators accountable is not in their best interests The immigration enforcement challenge for the Trump administration will be to keep a clear head and not succumb to the defective thinking advanced by open borders advocates and their media cronies
The Democrats have ditched their mildmannered bluecollar cant we all just get along façade for inyourface give us what we want now socialist revolution at any cost Theyve gone all in on a Green New Deal that gives government bureaucrats control of the economy and the power to turn 2020s Chinese quarantine into a permanent state of affairs Theyve declared the same carbon dioxide we all exhale a national health emergency not at all different from COVID19 Theyve declared systemic white supremacy and patriarchy health emergencies too Theyve declared that math is racist that police forces must be abolished and that abortions must be permitted after childbirth Theyve unleashed an army of Antifa and BLM insurgents to intimidate Americans through mayhem and violence and they accuse shocked observers who object to having their businesses looted and burned to the ground of being unreasonable bigots When the Democrats arent toppling statues of American heroes or preparing to pack the Supreme Court with comrade communists certain to find the Constitution unconstitutional they are actively censoring free speech using the criminal justice system to persecute their foes and threatening to kill conservatives one by one The Democrats may enforce mask mandates like the little authoritarians they are but theyve let their own political masks slip for good Gone are the days when they were willing to pretend to be part of a peaceful and American political party loyal to the Constitution and laws of the land They are an insurrectionist force now intent on destroying the America that exists today through any means necessary I believe that we are on the cusp of some of the greatest times in America or some of the worst Please vote Republican on November 3rd
UPDATE  EDIT Adding a direct link to the lawsuit  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton today filed a lawsuit against Georgia Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the United States Supreme Court The four states exploited the COVID19 pandemic to justify ignoring federal and state election laws and unlawfully enacting lastminute changes thus skewing the results of the 2020 General Election The battleground states flooded their people with unlawful ballot applications and ballots while ignoring statutory requirements as to how they were received evaluated and counted The cheaters have to be stopped Disenfranchisement occurs when people are deprived of the right to vote No one was deprived here What Trump is doing with his request that every legal vote count is asking that courts invalidate illegal votes You cannot disenfranchise an illegal voter whether that voter is dead a computer algorithm or a form filled out in a Chinese print shop Do you know what happens when you invalidate fraudulent votes and count only legal votes You identify the winner and loser in an election as has happened in America since 1792 Those who voted for the losing candidate were not disenfranchised they just voted for the losing candidate Count the legal votes and dont count the illegal votes Thats the right thing to do
 I dont listen to rap often Im older and its just not one of my favorite genres of music But I know who Kanye is and I know he influences many many people His courage to speak his mind under considerable pressure to just shut up is admirable I applaud him

NBCs SNL is able to circumvent restrictions on indoor gatherings by paying its instudio audiences 150 per person which technically makes them cast members according to a report from the New York Times This is a BS workaround to the laws that are destroying other businesses SNL should be ashamed of themselves
Hours before kickoff Washington had his officers read to the men excerpts of Thomas Paines The American Crisis a portion of which reads These are the times that try mens souls The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman Tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph By 400 pm the force was gathered at McKonkeys Ferry the launching point for the mission The watchword Victory or death was given When darkness set in the men climbed into the boats and began easing out into the black river Thank God for those brave Americans

I personally love how they specify race in this article like race really matters with self defense
Exactly Just look at the flared individuals here commenting who are willing to defy the constitution in the name of winning Thats not how it works at all
Normally functioning human beings regardless of political affiliation can see that Unfortunately the young generation left becomes unhinged when they dont get their way This includes assault and attempted murder of someone whos armed without consequences They want no one to be armed so they can do what they want in mob format
Rightfully so This is long overdue at this point but right decision nonetheless
Exactly my point Im tired of seeing people try to fight crazy with crazy Until we start holding our own accountable well always end up in this perpetual downfall of looking like a party of Alex Jones clones I refuse to be associated with people like that Theyre not conservatives theyre nutcases
This needs to be known more universally People fail to understand that but they tossed the race card when he banned travel They also tried to make excuses saying he didnt really know there was anything going on after it came out as an emergency
Somehow I doubt he even knows how to play chess set all Hes proven to everyone that hes been losing 4D chess for years now

Worst presidential campaign ever Joined late then left what maybe 2 months later His debate performances had the personability of a wet towel he showed no interesting qualities or unique legislative opinions His biggest achievements were flooding the country with ads and having more money than God Surprised No But whyd he even join Did he really think hed win Or was he trying to angle for some cabinet position

I think it may happen to be related to the the millions in donations from the Russian uranium mining company that the Clinton Foundation received while Hillary was Sec State She then supported a rule change that allowed Russia to own uranium mines in North America Russia now controls half of all uranium mining in North America and sells to countries like Iran and North Korea Or it may have something to do with Hillary campaign getting caught accepting illegal bundled contributions from China twice Gotta give style points for using a suitcase filled with cash Sounds like something out of a Taratino movie but its fn real LOL Or could be about Hillary helping her cronies profiteer off of the Haitian earthquake disaster via the State Dept Congrats on Chelseas awesome wedding Must be difficult to pull off a 32 million dollar party when you left the White House dead broke and made only 207300 from Sec State salary Or maybe she had a job on the side to make ends meet

A 63 increase in gasoline prices in the past year while Joe Biden suspends drilling and cancels pipelines
The media is irresponsible for doing so If it turns out Trump won because of fraud or a voting machine glitch the proBiden people will go nuts

 The recent report that the Biden administration is considering restricting the travel of Floridians is completely absurd especially when Biden allows illegal aliens to pour across our southern border he said

The New York Times published a distorted and factually incorrect story on the front page of the Sunday November 17 edition concerning FedEx and our billions of dollars of tax payments and billions of dollars of investments in the US economy Pertinent to this outrageous distortion of the truth is the fact that unlike FedEx the New York Times paid zero federal income tax in 2017 on earnings of 111 million Edit NY Times response to FedEX FedExs colorful response does not actually challenge a single fact in our story Were confident in the accuracy of our reporting Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha said in a statement FedExs invitation is clearly a stunt and an effort to distract from the findings of our story It is worth noting that the Times did not appear to dispute the allegations from Smith that the newspaper did not pay any federal income taxes in 2017 on earnings of 111 million

 Exactly like that The original smallpox vaccination was to intentionally get sick with cowpox Its a closely related but mostly harmless disease and if youve had that then you cant get smallpox Since smallpox has been extinct for a long time there has been little incentive to develop a more modern vaccine Even older actually The original preventative measure was to go through a grueling detox process think enemas bleeding etc and then have a small incision made in the upper arm Youd then get infected material packed inside and often have a short mild case of the disease If you survived which something like 98 did then youd have lifelong immunity

The project started in 1928 as part of the philanthropic Rosenwald Funds attempt to treat and control syphilis among blacks in the US South At the outset the study had the participants tested for syphilis then given a heavy metal treatment standard at the time In 1932 the Depression caused the Rosenwald Fund to end the control program as it could no longer afford the cost Dr Taliaferro Clark the Public Health Service advisor to the Rosenwald Fund decided to continue for another six months to a year He then wanted to treat the participants and end the study Clark retired in June 1932 and his successor Dr Raymond Vonderlehr decided to continue the Study to the death of all participants The PHS rationale was that studying syphilis longterm progression in black men would complement a 1910 Norwegian Study which did the same thing in whites as well as give some indication of treatments efficacy

For our downtown Houston office we are maybe 1020 percent And that has been mostly voluntary with some essential emergency response folks and IT folks in the office The communications I have been sent upstream asset development is that return to work is voluntary at this point People who need certain hardware or software can work in the office They appear to be planning on increasing that soon but I really dont know how they will go back to anything like it was Restrictions on elevator usage will be a big on I think most companies in high rises will see struggles there A limit of 26 people in the elevator will be real tough during morning lunch and end of day Sounds silly that something like that is such a big hurdle but big companies in these big buildings have to consider it
You will also find different operators with slightly different rates With contracts and multi rig discounts will you see variability Additionally you will find some odd numbers over the last year due to the downturn A lot of rigs sitting idle and rig companies during these times might be running discounts to keep rigs active Recommend trying to find data prior to the Covid pandemic Likely able to find more info too since there was more activity You could also reach out to the folks at oilandgasthisweekcom I am not affiliated with them but I have listened to their podcast and they seem to have a pretty good pulse on the industry

Once a dictator has committed serious human rights violations the only way for them to avoid prosecution by their own people or international courts is to remain in power That also applies to those around the leader Thus there is no limit to the horror of what may go on within that power structure

The objective of the Chinese communist government is to become the preeminent superpower on the face of the Earth the preeminent military power the preeminent economic power and to dictate its will across the globe I believe China poses the most significant geopolitical threat for the United States over the next century because its ambitions are unlimited and its record of torture murder lies and oppression would only grow worse were China to achieve its objective of global superiority In practice communism is about power domination and almost inevitably it has resulted in poverty and misery The Chinese Communist Party desires to exercise complete control over the Chinese citizenry their speech their religion their economic activities and over everything they say do or think every minute of the day With technology that specter is becoming more and more of a reality Communist governments consistently engage in massive surveillance of their citizens to brutally punish and eliminate the sense Xi Jinping is quite content to be an absolute dictator Nails it

Given my limited knowledge of Star WarsI am going to say that itll be an intense fight but I think that Stitch wins most fights However I think more Jedis will survive Order 626 because a few Jedis will accidentally find his weakness to water Youll also have some intense Jedi battles using whatever force thing they can do but in the end Stitch wins Also does anyone know if Stitch is weak to snow Since its water Uh Anyways It is believed that under 1 of the Jedis survived order 66 but with Order 626 I am going to make a random estimate of 1025 surviving or possibly even higher With this they can share the knowledge with other Jedi about Stitches weakness and overcome any Stitches they encounter So with more Jedis left the Empire have a lot stronger Rebellion to deal with due to having a strong number of Jedis joining them TLDR Stitches will win but Jedis from order 626 have a higher survival rate than those of Order 66 EDIT As some have corrected me Stitch weakness is actually that he is very dense not that he is weak to water So a random Jedi might have some luck to push him in the lake and win but thats by chance so I am going to stick to my theory of the survival rate just being higher

88 of abortions are performed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy the baby doesnt usually feel pain till around week 20 onward However at week 4 is the typical time a woman tests positive and at week 5 the heart begins to beat Now although the baby wont feel pain for another 15 weeks it still means it could be argued to be murder If I shoot u in the head or you get the lethal injection it wont hurt but youll still die
 So again thank you George Floyd for sacrificing your life for justice Who the hell is she trying to appeal to with this line SMHOnly Nancy could come up with a statement that is credibly offensive to EVERY PERSON in this nation

 In the tweet Maxwell posted a collage of photos showing Barrett at her confirmation hearing wearing a mask to help prevent the spread of COVID19 in the Senate chamber and images from scenes in The Handmaids Tale a TV series based on the Margaret Atwood novel depicting the sexual enslavement of women to repopulate the earth Sorry but this has been on my mind all day Maxwell tweeted So we force people to wear masks and then we make fun of them for wearing masks The lefts agenda really is just to degrade people And its pretty creepy that Amy Coney Barrett in a mask looking like a sexslave from The Handmaids Tale has been on Maxwells mind all day Thats really something she should keep to herself

The SlaveFree Business Certification Act would require  American business that takes in over 500 million worldwide to conduct audits and have CEOs certify to the US Department of Labor that their companies are not using slave labor in their supply chains in addition to publishing a report of the companys efforts to ensure their supply chains are free of forced labor The bill would also allow the Labor Secretary to fine companies up to 500 million for failing to comply Slavery is still a very real problem in this world I wonder if all these oppressed Americans lecturing us about rampant systemic racism in this country ever considered whose hands made the over priced Nike shoes on their feet and the ridiculously expensive iPhone in their hand
Trump supporters took my job away from me she claims I have gotten death threats rape threats violent threats It was OK but now my futures entirely compromised because Trump supporters have decided to come for my life Rightjust like Trump supporters took away Kathy Griffins gig at CNN after she posted a funny photo of her holding a bloody Trump head Maybe Ms Janover and Ms Griffin should start a support group

Fuck you You useless piece of shit You absolute waste of space and air You uneducated ignorant idiotic dumb swine youre an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did When Jesus died for our sins he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality After you die your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son for youd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos through which unrecognizable core you can only find misfortune I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering worse than any human concept of hell You are such an unholy being that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair You are an idiotic shiteating dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you Rhodes Island would have been better off if youd never joined us You are a lying backstabbing cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up and how incredibly idiotic you are Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time for if divine beings were real they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe In the future there will be horror stories made about you with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination but here you are Its hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes but here I am so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence Even if I did my very best my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you Even if time travel some day will be invented there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you Not a single word of the incoherent illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had making concepts such as laws irrelevant Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring You are the worst human being or even just being in general that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created but not even mankinds greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created If you ever had them your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are except you will never be able to have children because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents but to your ancestors and entire bloodline The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again The sheer scale of your mistake if ever to be materialized would not only surpass the size of the world but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known and almost certainly the unknown universe I could sit here and write paragraphs nay books describing your immense failure yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world You are an irresponsible idiotic disgusting unloved horrible excuse for a living being whos soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now Honestly even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate and honestly I do not want to exaggerate but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest my hate is almost certainly bottomless There is no one in this world that has ever loved you and especially after what you just did no one will ever love you in the future either There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better and in fact quite the opposite might be true By making the mistake that you just did you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in

I grew up always having declawed cats in the house I thought it was normal and that the cats didnt care once healed So unfortunately I had my first cat declawed At the time I didnt know how it actually affects them and my vet at the time didnt inform me either I feel awful about it after I learned what declawing actually does to a cat My cat has adjusted to it as good as she could have Its been 8 years since and I still wish I hadnt done it Never again Ps I now use a different vet A cat only vet who actively advocates against declawing I think theyll still do it for an owner who insists but I they fully describe what it does to the cat first Also when they do declaw I know they use a surgical laser instead of traditional methods Still not good but better than the old methods
When I tried at the one at the Clyde Park Meijer it didnt work When I looked behind it I noticed that the network cable isnt plugged in I told someone at the service desk and they said it was the Secretary of states problem not theirs and refused to do anything about it So I got the full SOS experience right at Meijer They truly are a one stop shop
The raid timer starts at 78 crates Only fill it to 77 to avoid a raid
Its even worse within Michigan Have you ever heard Grand Rapids people talk about Detroit

Anyone who doesnt realize that Vice is one of the CIAs newer mouthpiece media assets is just clueless They started by pushing all these drug and sex stories to seem like the cool news Then they started peppering in establishment talking points Its hilarious that they portray themselves as counterculture when they parrot every establishment talking point But then they do a story about drugs and everyone thinks theyre cool again

How is this not an embarrasment for the UFC OMalley is a top prospect and being talked about as the next MMA super star Then they match him up with a guy who just admitted he has no time to really train even at the amateur level This is really stupid They should have found a guy on the roster to fight OMalley or just canceled the fight If OMalley hits this guy with a devastating KO its going to look horrible

If you test again can you see how fast the SBMM changes where it puts you It feels like after only a few games you can get swapped to a different level I seem to always have a few good games then I get killed Then after a few games of losing bad I start winning again and the other players are noticeably worse I think for around 1 kd and below you seesaw back and forth pretty quick with SBMM Once you are over 1 kd it keeps you with good players for a lot longer
What I still dont understand is why everybody on the plane just allowed three guys to kill the pilots and then assume they would be safe if they just sat calmly in their seats They said the hijackers locked themselves in the cockpit but it was after 911 when they upgraded the cockpit doors to be stronger Before that they were just flimsy panels with a little latch anyone could kick open I dont hear this talked about much but wouldnt the passengers have heard the hijackers killing all the flight crew in the cockpit and realize they needed to try something Even if they didnt realize the hijackers were on a suicide mission they should have at least realized they probably cant land the plane I cant believe two planeloads of people all just decided to sit around after the flight crew had been murdered
If you listen to mainstream hip hop its all very nihilistic The lyrics are all about using people taking whatever you can and not caring about anything Modern hip hop and rap is pushing this type of nihilism so dont be surprised when you find out they dont care if people die at a show

I think a lot of NFL and NBA players got fake vaccine certificates from the same doctors they use to get their PED expertise Theyre all on steroids so they obviously have personal doctors that help with that They would easily give them a fake vaccine certificate

How can this be not permitted One private citizen going to another private citizens house for the purpose of asking for candy cant be outlawed by decree This may sound silly but legally the act of trick or treating involves a lot of different actions To outright ban the whole activity basically bans several other activities such as interactions going outside etc What you are noticing is that people are no longer requiring laws to actually be passed The public is becoming fine with the government just putting out statements with rules to follow under the threat of vague penalties
How does this get upvoted You act like these executives forced people to use electricity and cars for the past 100 years People with free will in a free market demanded this energy and bought it with their own money The market customers created the demand for fossilfuel energy So to follow the logic of this idiot author you should charge all customers of fossilfuel energy with crimes against humanity as well This is one of the dumbest arguments Ive ever seen make it to the front page of Reddit
This is what a lot of people dont understand For a conspiracy to take place or even just a giant misguided fuck up everybody involved doesnt have to be a willing participant Only a few at the top need to guide things and everybody else just falls in line because the world is set up like that Its all a hierarchy so the top controls everything
This The hypocrisy is disgusting

Nah probably just inconsistent with their timeline I think its a bit more minute problems in the propaganda that causes them to have to ban it lest people notice that history has been changed by the government Also the Kuomintang in hoi4 is the one doing the main part of the fighting which I suppose the CCP would not like as it sorta paints the Kuomintang as the people who saved China from the Japanese

100 every article covering this makes sure to bury the whites not allowed aspect down in the middle of the article Even then it just mentions it in passing and goes on to glorify the sentiment of the assistance ZERO acknowledgment of how divisive and discriminatory this is Especially when there are over 10k white families living under the poverty line in this area identified as being eligible for the payments outside of their race

As female who has been the exact same person youre describing I can tell you that youre absolutely correct That being said the guy who played your role he was very damn stubborn We did the friend dance but there was always something more there He dated elsewhere while I kept doing the unavailable thing It took about 23 years but he was always willing to try I took myself to therapy He was the first person I decided I wanted to actually give myself to completely after Id gotten some counseling under my belt Theres been a few hiccups but its been the best relationship of my life We were friends more than anything I KNEW he cared for me as more than just the label he wished we had and he never gave up on me This helped me build trust for him and us because I learned that when he told me things like Ill never love someone like I love you well after 3 years of patience and seeing him just show up fix a wall when I drive my car into it Lol visit me on my lunch break one day because Id had a rough shift cooking a special plate that I like at our friends pot luck gatherings because Im allergic to everything else lol Even while he was dating others and traveling etc he showed me that he meant what he said Had he just bailed because I couldnt give him exactly what he wanted the way and how he wanted Id think he was very selfish and feel like I dodged a bullet If there really is a connection and you know there are legitimate issues for her emotional unavailability consider being patient Guard your heart distance yourself and carry on with your life but dont abandon her Not if you truly care for her I know I put my boyfriend through some pain trust me I was in pain too because I didnt like having feelings and caring for him yet not being able to jump in and not being able to control it but he never gave up on me and said he always felt there was something in me deep down that wanted it too We had a large circle of mutual friends so that helped us to stay in contact I guess Bottom line protect your heart DONT SLEEP WITH HER dont even try to date her Be her friend after taking a little time for yourself Get out there and date Be honest with her Encourage her to work on her issues You never know what the future may bring You cant yank on a flower and expect it to grow
Yes I used to stand in the mirror and cry my eyes out How much I hated that bag and hated looking at it and how awful my life was going to be having been forced to have it It took me a few months but I started to realize that without the bag I wouldnt have been able to stand in the mirror and cry at all Its hard to wrap your head around hating and being so embarrassed about something that literally saved your life I ended up having a successful reversal about two months after I became an ostomy pro that had fully embraced it for what it was I know that there is always a chance that it will happen again and now I am much more prepared There are so many great tools and techniques out there now that its very easy to be undetected unless you choose it to be As Im sure you know Hugs to you momma

My ex husband who I caught and only now in retrospect know was porn addiction he turned it around and attacked my appearance I had just given birth to our son via csection 3 months prior He started using that as an excuse for all of his wandering eye porn and masturbation use and withholding if sex etc mind you the person I ultimately caught him having an affair with was twice my size As for my current partner the porn problem is a brand new discovery He says it is for him as well because he didnt think it was really an addiction or the cause of his sexual dysfunctions etc either way he sought help immediately and has been seeking help for us together as well as a sex therapist He spends every day trying to convince me that it has nothing to do with me that Im physically everything he desires and have always been his ultimate goal etc We gone hours about this problem Ive cried and questioned etc he hasnt wavered or made an excuse about it being my appearance We have discussed his childhood decades long conditioning lack of intimate touch etc as being the reasons
Porn is not safe ESPECIALLY when it comes to teen You are skating a line You are hoping for the legality of a birthday but understand that looks can indicate something different Thats not even touching on the major sex trafficking issue going on You may not have to worry so much about the trafficking issue but I would really question myself if I was this concerned about the age demographic I was drawn to for porn

Truly loving a person is loving them above everything Its our ego that gets in the way a lot It takes a tremendous amount of maturity and love to be able to look at things in the way that you are for your ex Either that or you are really in to self sabotage lol It also speaks volumes that he wanted to reach out to you for you to meet his new partner Its bittersweet Im sure

In case my reply gets lost Hamas conducts military operations including rocket attacks against Israeli civilian centers from their own schools hospitals and residential neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip When Israel necessarily retaliates to defend its people Hamas propagandists are there to film their own citizens getting hurt because of Hamas own actions in order to smear the Israelis and to generate more hate towards Israel and therefore more power for Hamas The media falls for it every time as does most of Reddit and Twitter apparently

State governor Phil Scott made the announcement Monday and said he would drop existing physical distancing crowd size restrictions and masking requirements State officials had initially planned to lift all remaining restrictions by the Fourth of July but brought the decision forward after Vermonts vaccination rate reached its goal The ingenuity creativity and dedication of all Vermonters to their friends and families to their neighbors and to their communities has been incredible and we should all be very proud Scott said in a statement

Just a perspective from someone who has actually made an IOS app Just for myself and to teach myself I never went for an android version mostly because it took so much time already to make an IOS app Porting everything over to another platform is not as easy as clicking a button Apple uses a totally different programming language altogether separate from android Apples main language is objectivecswift Where android is Java EDIT not to mention when youre making an app They have simulators for every major IPhoneandroid that you can think of to test and run your code Those simulators can almost be laughed at If you want to realistically release an app You need to physically test it on every device Not on a simulator There is a much more diverse amount of androids that need to be taken into consideration unlike iPhones where you generally only have 2 new phones every year
Apex just needs an experimental server like PUBG Let the devs play around with concepts and get feed back from the community playing with it Of course you wouldnt go on there for ranked or anything Just like sieges test server All ranks are reset every time its up and all progress is lost Its just for testing No packs no rank nothing Just testing

This is what happens when a website is ran by teenagers who think they are changing the world one upvote at a time In all seriousness though Most of reddit had no clue what they are talking about and most of the popular opinions on reddit is actually the minority opinions for the rest of the world EDIT Ive been at work This kind of blew up Thanks for the awards everyone

Yeah Probably all over the world many flu were in reality coronavirus infections And unfortunately this means flights from China should have been blocked much earlier Italy did so on 1st February US shortly after unfortunately it was too late
I guess he got really angry because some young people still do not take it seriously in Campania as they said we will do graduation parties the same
Exactly Stop massive outsourcing Also Taiwan made is ok anyway
Mind you that the virus started in China in OctoberNovember As China told WHO much later  and Wuhan was put in lockdown only on 22nd January nobody in the world knew about coronavirus except China This means people from Wuhan who went to the fair passed it to the Italian standers and that would explain why Codogno and Rimini are one of the worsthit areas
Good but it should have been posted as Good news flair
Yeah unfortunately too many of them avoided travel bans which still happened too late unfortunately by doing layovers in other countries Some people traveled even while having a fever by taking paracetamol in order to cheat thermic scans one Chinese woman in France proudly admitted to do so on social media see here 
Translation in English Coronavirus Salvini If China knew its crime against humanity Posted on 26032020 1231 If the Chinese government knew it did not report and did not protect people it committed a crime against humanity says the senator and leader of Lega Matteo Salvini in a passage of the intervention at Palazzo Madama after the information of Prime Minister Conte in the Chamber You cannot pass those who have infected the world as saviors Exclaimed the Northern League Lega is a right wing conservative party in Italy
Yes but now there are scientific proofs based on virus mutations Sacco Hospital is one of the most advanced hospitals for infectious diseases in Europe
So what it proves it started in China as genome analysis already proved Wuhan people came to Italy even if they had already an epidemic in their city not caring about passing it to others as China said to WHO no evidence of human to human transmission International media started talking about coronavirus only after Wuhan was in lockdown but the disease started already in 2019 autumn in China See The Guardian as well
Perhaps a sciencebased society will rise
Because Germany blocked the export of all medical products even if bought before this block to all other countries
I wish I were in China were millions of people are killed brainwashed tortured you have spies everywhere wet markets are rampant and pollution is much bigger than all over the world because there is no Trumpno racist white person11 libtard
You could tell the same to France Spain and US Its not time to bash now All Western countries have undervalued the risk not just Italy Besides not all governement forces undervalued it Governator Fontana asked and still asks for tougher measures but was deemed anxious if not racist by central governement

The military loved this guy when he made them look good for saving a baby during the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan Now that he told his story at a Trump rallytheyre going after himGuy should be awarded a medal and instead this administration wants to punish him for the apparent crime of appearing with Trump and not even in uniform

Everyone should watch the documentary on Netflix called The Social Dilemma Its a real eye opener about social media and its effects on our society Its mostly interviews with people who developed and programmed the social media software Facebook Twitter Instagram and others These are the people who started the whole thing and most of them wont even allow their children to use social media until at least high school They are very concerned with the unintended consequences of social media And recently the social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook interfered with posting on their sites thereby showing that they are not neutral in any sense So they are in fact publishing sites not neutral internet sites protected by Section 230 Their effects on our society and especially the recent election is disastrous and they need to be held accountable for their actions

Ask me anything Retalks mission is to create a platform with civil discussion for the centerright We launched almost exactly a year ago We have a similar format to Reddit although with elements from Twitter and Substack built in I strongly suspect Reddit will become more restrictive and censorious as it comes close to an IPO which could be an interesting development in the next year
What gets my goat is that they say 50000 but Im guessing the real number is leagues beyond that
There are a few sitewide rules no actual racism not defined the way woke people do it no calls for violence no encouraging illegal behaviour No porn either Apart from that we will try and let the communities and moderators define their own rules for communities Although the ideal is civil conversation that is more a mission and a north star than a hard rule People can sometimes be uncivil they can get into arguments thats fine Were all human Just try and be civil most of the time

Gettr and Parler are Twitter clones They are about following people especially VIPs and influencers You can see in the way they launched and got popular that they very much rely on people following big personalities and in Parlers case without the big people there isnt much of a product there Gab is pretty big but has a big problem with its reputation It seems to have turned into a very very christian social site It is also very unmoderated which means there is a lot of content that turns normal centercenter right people off Retalk is more like Reddit or facebook groups We are trying to build communities that anyone can enjoy and participate it Its grassroots communities I really hope that even without big republicanright wing names we can still build a really good product

Ive been an entrepeneur for 15 years with varying levels of success I was looking for something that was 1 within my abilities to create 2 but still a big challenge 3 and could potentially make a huge difference in the world I am also following the whole woke movement quite closely mostly to my horror and somehow this all came together to starting Retalk which brings all of these together I really think the world needs the market to provide more social media sites that arent all ruled by the silicon valley elite Government regulation is not the answer even if it seems like a quick solution The process started with parler but there is a very long road ahead

Left my previous employer in December of 2020 My current employer is a competitor Same business and I was going to a very similar role but receiving a 40 increase When I gave the notice to my manager he said that if I was going to a competitor and if I wanted to disclose the position and offer Id accepted he could take it to management to see if they would counter Keep in mind the department had been bleeding employees half the department was a year or less in tenure and shortly after I started in that role they raised the starting rate for the position but didnt extend it to those who were making less but wanted us to mentor the new employees So I responded to him Ok I highly doubt theyll match or make a better offer but the role I accepted is _______ at ________ and the salary offer was _________ He said okay Ill let you know Less than 2 hours later I got an email from him letting me know that management would not be able to match and declined to even make a counter offer They literally didnt give two shits that I was walking out the door

I previously worked at Walmart Im a dude and not small but my job and what I got paid to do was cashier Was approached by one assistant manager one night and was removed from the cash register and sent to the back to unload a truck because no one showed from the unloading team I get back there and its all middle aged women also plucked from other departments so guess who got on the truck The truck looked like it was loaded by a hurricane Eventually I pulled the wrong box and started an avalanche This was before flat screens were on every tv and a 30 inch CRT TV rolled down the mountain and hit me in the shoulder About ten minutes later I notice my arm going numb and it progressively gets worse Decide to report it and a second assistant manager tried to get me to leave and go to the hospital I told him I already knew that I had to go to the Walmart approved doctor otherwise any potential workers comp would be void So the next day I go to their approved Dr who said most likely a pinched nerve and swelling She trusted me to stay off my arm but didnt trust Walmart to let me so she gave me a soft arm sling and a note to take to Walmart saying I shouldnt lift anything with my left arm for two weeks They made me work door greeter rather than give me workers compensation but that was fine Later the same manager who tried to trick me into going to the wrong Dr asked me to stay over and help set up school supplies for back to school I said I would but only if it was extra hours and that I wouldnt have hours cut the next day which was the last day of the schedule He said yes so I stayed Sure enough I got sent home the next day They will fucking lie to your face and put you on a situation you arent trained or prepared for just so they can go sit back down in the office

The objective of the Chinese communist government is to become the preeminent superpower on the face of the Earth the preeminent military power the preeminent economic power and to dictate its will across the globe I believe China poses the most significant geopolitical threat for the United States over the next century because its ambitions are unlimited and its record of torture murder lies and oppression would only grow worse were China to achieve its objective of global superiority In practice communism is about power domination and almost inevitably it has resulted in poverty and misery The Chinese Communist Party desires to exercise complete control over the Chinese citizenry their speech their religion their economic activities and over everything they say do or think every minute of the day With technology that specter is becoming more and more of a reality Communist governments consistently engage in massive surveillance of their citizens to brutally punish and eliminate the sense Xi Jinping is quite content to be an absolute dictator Nails it

This is common knowledge Obama counted catch and release as deportation Sessions changed this back when he got in Obama didnt really deport many and of course was all about using immigration legal or illegal for fundamental transformation

Except you cant defend your private property with your own means anymore White couple protects their home after protestors storm through a gate protecting private property national outrage 100000 upvotes on Reddit comments calling for them to be arrested immediately Groups of people in Chicago destroy their own city loot businesses smash windows fight officers silence and completely buried with a headline meant to downplay the situation Crowds clash with police Right If you dont know by now that this website has a certain narrative I dont know what to tell you anymore
Those who ignore their history are doomed to repeat it We didnt just have egg on our faces said Tom Brokaw of NBC Newsit was an entire omelette This election isnt over until SCOTUS rules and those of you who are conceding before Trump does and before the eventual ruling are quitters I know today is hard what with seeing liberals everywhere celebrate in the streets and on social media but hang tight Theres a lot more game to be played
Reddit has already removed 3 posts on the rnews subreddit related to this and the current one up has a weird title meant to portray it like a its not a big deal Its not on the trending page its not anywhere on rpolitics despite BLM Chicago calling it a protest and seemingly being OK with it and youll never ever ever see rblackpeopletwitter allow that to be on their page much less condemn it On this subreddit we post everything Even when Trump did that Axios interview we allowed that to be here and talked about it Because we dont gaslight people like the left does Its an absolute denial of reality and complete insanity not just by Reddit but also by CNN MSNBC and NBC news I cant believe what this country has become
 Violence and looting takes place in inner cities Local officials refuse to press charges Package delivery companies refuse to deliver goods to those areas Civilians get fed up and businesses pack up and leave for other areas Inner cities become even more disadvantaged Local officials blame racism and white flight Rinse and repeat Its really becoming hilariously evident that Democrats have absolutely no idea how to run their cities
 This is literal insanity and Trump Derangement Syndrome TDS personified Hes getting closer and closer to breaking these peoples brains for good simply by existing Tens of thousands of leftistsliberals are now claiming that Trump faked his diagnosis as a publicity stunt They have absolutely no idea how anything actually truly works and dont understand the international crisis and the issues that arose from the most powerful man in the world getting sick From the markets going down to potential enemies using it as an opportunity to strike to so much more Their ignorance is mind blowing These are the same morons who were wishing him death and talking about the 25th amendment to the point that it was trending 1 worldwide for a few hours all weekend and saying that POTUS is incapacitated and the cabinet needs to make him step down immediately This isnt even funny anymore Theyve been attempting a coup on the President of the United States for 4 years straight Lie after lie after lie from Russian collusion to faking Covid to the stroke he supposedly had These are the same people who think we live under fascism If you actually truly lived under fascism you wouldnt even be able to think about making those types of comments much less post them and other lies repeatedly for 4 years straight

Shakur also known as Joanne Chesimard was convicted in the 1973 killing of a New Jersey state trooper She subsequently escaped prison fled to Cuba and has never been found If it is not possible to imagine putting a 17 tall mural of nurse killer Richard Speck in front of a hospital or putting a 17 tall mural of Dan White who assassinated San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk in front of a mayors house the atrocity of the celebration of a fugitive convicted cop killer in front of Palo Altos City Hall is equally reprehensible the petition read Its beyond insane to me that people would not only celebrate a brazen cop killer in this way but to put a mural of her right across the street from a police department And for the city and the Mayor to not order it be taken down immediately What is going on in this country
NAL but am a dispatcher and Assistant Terminal Agency Coordinator for my agency This is illegal and will result in consequences for both the dispatcher and the agency NCIC and your states equivalent is not a dating program It is also super easy to track as everything you do is recorded Whats more there are some flags for abuse that alert security that someone might be doing something unacceptable 1 Contact the department preferably when shes not working Ask to speak to the chief if a smallish department or the dispatch supervisor One of them will be the TAC for their agency Meet with them in person and file a complaint 2 Contact the MA DCJIS offices Their number can be found here  I believe they manage the state databases as well as the states access to NCIC Find out who handles complaints about abuse of these databases This isnt something that these agencies take lightly nor do the police departments Penalties can range from hefty fines on the dispatcher as well as the agency jail time state dependent for the dispatcher and loss of access to the agency Looking back a couple elections do you remember Joe the Plumber He was some guy who asked Obama some hard questions while running for the Presidency After he ended up in the news a local police records clerk ran him through their system It flagged almost immediately and she faced charges over it Another more frequent abuse is dispatcherscopsclerks with rental properties who do background checks on prospective tenants
24 hours seems awful short but probably That said contact your housing office and discuss whatever your situation is My local college is allowing some international students we have a very high population from over seas who will remain in their dormitory for a bit longer and I believe are setting up short term apartment rentals for those US students who cannot leave right away So if you need a couple days they might be able to help you out If you want another month youre out of luck
If she checked you through the state DMV computer the state crime computer whatever MA calls theirs or NCIC its logged Shed have a hard time proving she had cause to do it If it is through the Computer Aided Dispatch program it almost definitely logs every tiny thing she does and is again easily traceable If it was through the departments police report program it most likely has an audit function of some sort Using the CADReporting system for personal use is going to be against policy in any agency and probably illegal although Im not familiar with your state It could be possible I suppose that she checked those online background checkdetective sites Im not exactly sure what they give you especially if you were a juvenile at the time but the simplest answer is that she used all of the technology available to her at work to wrongly violate your privacy

The issue for most of us isnt leaving We cant be there forever However packing up and bugging out without a gradual exit plan is what gave us ISIS Leaving doesnt do us any good if we have to turn around and go back in a year or two later to stop another terror group or slaughter Copying Obamas mistakes isnt the smart thing to do Second many have issue with the message that this sends to allies During Desert Storm we told the Kurds to rise up and that wed back them They trusted us and did as we asked We promptly abandoned them and they slaughtered by Saddam Then we decide to go back into Iraq and again ask them for help Thinking we mean business they ally with us again and fight diligently alongside us Now were abandoning them again Theyre surrounded by the Iranians Syrians and Turks all who would happily line up every Kurdish man woman and child shoot them and leave them in a mass grave Eventually were going to need to deploy troops again somewhere in the world Wherever it is well need allies Who on Earth would be stupid enough to ally with the US knowing that if it becomes even mildly politically inconvenient well leave them to be mass murdered Why not ally with Russia or China instead and refuse to help us at every single step possible As for Israel they are the only stable ally we have in the region Why shouldnt we support them Does anyone actually think we can just go it alone and have no friends or allies Even if you do arrogantly think that is possible it still doesnt make sense Our alliance with Israel has in some cases allowed us to force restraint on their part and in others to make their neighbors think twice about attacking them While this might not matter to some people if such a war were to happen and should Israel start to lose they have nuclear weapons If pressed to use them you can kiss a large portion of the worlds oil supplies goodbye for years This would hurt us a great deal and Im not just talking about gas and oil prices Even if we were fully energy independent the rest of the world isnt and the rest of the world buys American goods If they suddenly are going through economic crises due to fuel shortages it would hurt us a great deal Stability in the region matters for us on many levels If were going to pull out we need to do it gradually and with a solid exit strategy We need to ensure that stability continues and that a premature exit doesnt cause more problems than it solves Mattis and other national security experts know this Trump doesnt seem to tldr Copying Obamas playbook is only going to cause us more problems in the long run

Isnt it in the first amendment that we have the right to protest Yes Burning buildings is not protesting though Attacking firefighters is not protesting Breaking into stores and stealing things is not protesting Using lasers to blind news pilots and police on rooftops is not protesting Blocking ambulances from helping people is not protesting Cutting gas lines to create an explosion is not protesting Assaulting people is not protesting How is this not government overstepping boundaries Dont most conservatives believe in small government The government fired the officers and will pursue charges Police elsewhere have roundly condemned what happened here The local mayor has sided with protesters not rioters and will go after the cops The system is working It would have worked sooner but failed Democrat presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar chose to let the main officer in this tragedy get away with all sorts of stuff by declining to prosecute him in the past Do you really think police opening fire on civilians once the looting starts the shooting starts is really the solution Wasnt this all started because of policemen wrongfully killing civilians No It doesnt solve anything and would only make things worse as many of the rioters are armed as well I dont believe the Presidents Tweets are helpful In fact I believe they are harmful As for the National Guard being there the reality is they do even less than the police in these sorts of situations Theyre not going to be running around shooting people no matter what Trump or those upset at him think

Hi Im a previous suicide hotline volunteer in the UK I ceased to be one around 12 months ago because of stress and my own mental health making me less confident of my ability to help people when I was myself in a fragile state I fully believe everything youve been saying in the UK all of the hotlines I know of aim to get someone to answer within 3 rings however thats not always possible I always hated knowing that someone was waiting and there was nothing I can do but thats about a lack of recruitment and not because the person on the other end just doesnt care One thing Ive heard however at least with some American hotlines is that when they receive a call they might contact the police if they think someone is in immediate danger of suicide I have always been taught not to do this and besides I have no way of knowing where the caller is unless they tell me however it seems like a really strange thing to do Is this something that actually happens if so why

I have a law degree so Ive had to look up British law very often during my studies and it is very easy to find It is however not the easiest thing to read and I feel this does need to be rectified in some way The issue is that in a common law legal system at least judges are regularly required to interpret the law and decide on parliamentary intention when making judgements obviously the first text they will refer to in that instance is the statute law in question Therefore parliamentarians have a vested interest in making the law extremely specific and fiddly in order to give the least possible amount of wiggle room when it comes to interpretation Obviously this has the unintended side effect of making the law difficult for many people to understand leading to increased ignorance To rectify this I believe the best course of action is to create and properly fund a free information service which carefully spells out the provisions of the law in an easy to follow way so there isnt a massive amount of statute reading people who havent been trained to read laws need to do Of course there are many areas of law where this would be extremely difficult either to write or to codify Tax law for instance is one where it would be hard to create an easy read version its an absolute trap for the unwary traveler and a lot of perfectly good lawyers want absolutely nothing to do with it for that reason You really do need a lawyer who specialises in tax law Another area where it would be difficult is the part of law written almost exclusively by judges in which it really can be hard to find the court case that backs up your point or destroys it if the violation is a really fiddlyancient one

Even the NYTimes profile on her was mostly positive of her with a few potshots here and there x200B Legal scholars said Judge Barretts opinions on the appeals court have been models of judicial craftsmanship tightly reasoned and unflashy Her conservatism is embedded in her methodological and jurisprudential commitments not any commitment to a particular policy outcome said Jonathan H Adler a law professor at Case Western Reserve University As a scholar and a judge she has shown herself to be a very careful and deliberate thinker who is concerned with getting the right answer whether or not its the popular answer x200B Still those who know Judge Barrett say she is not ideological in her writings Every Notre Dame Law School faculty member supported her elevation to the appellate court noting they did so in spite of their different political persuasions One of her former students said that in class she would not have known Ms Barrett was Catholic and that she did not start class with prayer or the sign of the cross like other professors at Notre Dame x200B Peers describe her as a textualist like Justice Scalia one who interprets the law based on its plain words as opposed to someone who looks to accomplish the legislatures purpose And they said she was an originalist meaning a judge who interprets the Constitution according to the understanding of those who drafted and ratified it Justice Kennedy showed a willingness to interpolate things into the Constitution that in cases like Obergefell that Justice Scalia for example would not have done said John Garvey the president of the Catholic University of America who taught Judge Barrett in law school referring to the 2015 decision that established a constitutional right to samesex marriage My guess is that Judge Barrett wouldnt assume that the judicial role carried that much power with it x200B In a 2017 law review article written before she joined the appeals court Judge Barrett was critical of Chief Justice John G Roberts Jrs 2012 opinion sustaining a central provision of the Affordable Care Act saying he had betrayed the commands of textualism Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute she wrote x200B In the world of conservative judges she has particularly strong credentials Judge Barrett began clerking for Justice Antonin Scalia 22 years ago and her fellow clerks are quick to say she was his favorite She graduated summa cum laude from Notre Dame Law School and joined the faculty in 2002 earning praise from colleagues as an astute scholar and jurist even if they did not always agree on her jurisprudential premises

There is a whole field of study theodicy devoted to answering these questions so if you want answers there is plenty to find That being said if you just want my personal take on it it comes down to a question of optimization To question Gods morality vis a vis the existence of evil is to fundamentally accuse God of poor design Essentially you are saying that the system is suboptimal By necessity you need to define the optima to be able to determine if a system is in fact suboptimal It would seem that you are trying to establish an optima based off of some kind of moral good How can this be measured Lets say by whether or not it minimizes suffering If this were the case then as you pointed out the system is suboptimal In fact if God had made us all plants we would never know suffering So would the world be a better place if we were all just mindless plants It doesnt seem so Why not Well there is a lot of good in this world that comes from the fact that we have minds and can form relationships So perhaps the existence of love could be an optima As it happens when optimizing a system you can and often do have to consider multiple optima An airplane is clearly inferior to a tank if the only consideration is durability But if we also want to optimize for being light enough to fly fuel efficiency as a function of weight aerodynamics etc carrying capacity etc a Boeing 747 is better optimized than an Abrams Is it better than a B52 though Well that is an issue of which of the competing optima are prioritized over others For military applications durability and being able to withstand small arms fire are going to be a bigger priority than in commercial applications Likewise cargo capacity is a higher priority relative to passenger capacity if you want to drop a bunch of bombs Which optima are higher or lower in priority are dependent on the intended function or purpose So we have to determine the multiple competing optima for the world we live in and their priority relative to the purpose for the existence of the world We have to know why we are here Do you know that Because that is one of the greatest mysteries of the ages so if you have that figured out you should probably share with the rest of the class I dont claim to have it all figured out but I know it isnt simply to exist in the absence of suffering If God wanted that He would have just made a garden He didnt just make a garden He also made Adam and Eve What is the purpose of humanity Well in the same way that we could say that we wouldnt be better off as plants because we would never experience love could we not consider love as an optima for the creation of the world What would that look like How do you optimize for love What does it require In the same way that an airplane cant achieve flight without sufficient lift generated by the wings to offset the weight love requires free will Noone ever loved anybody involuntarily So how do we optimize for free will An old quote from Henry ford when they first started mass production of the model T was something to the effect of you can have any color you want so long as its black The joke being that if you restrict all the choices down to one then it is no longer a choice We cant love unless we are given the option not to love Likewise we cant actually do good or at least it is no credit to us unless we have the option to do evil Free will is baked into the cake so to speak Without it we could never love eachother or God What does having actual free will look like How much freedom does it take to really be free Often we look at cultures with arranged marriages and criticize them for not having true love If you are technically free to marry whoever you want but there is just this one person that your parents arranged for you to marry and society expects you to marry that person and almost everybody else that you could possibly marry is already betrothed to their arranged marriage so you choose to go along with your arranged marriage was that really your own choice Likewise consider if God was visibly physically omnipresent He automatically smites anyone who does any evil and you have the choice of whether to love Him and follow Him orit really isnt much of a choice Logically noone would ever be able to choose not to follow You know how people feel awkward at work when their boss is there working with them and they feel like they are constantly being scrutinized and it is really stressful Imagine that turned up to eleven Is that the kind of world that would be properly optimized for Gods purposes Not likely So we have to be totally free to commit unspeakable evils and choose to do good instead We have to be completely free to ignore God and choose to love Him instead That does open the door for a multitude of suffering but that is what is necessary And as it happens knowing God is far and away greater in magnitude than any amount of suffering and lasts for an eternity while all suffering is but a breath Now you might criticize me or God Himself for taking lightly the suffering we endure for the sake of the opportunity to be in relationship with Him Is He ignorant of our suffering Does He know how we feel Does He even care Well He gave up his only son to be brutally murdered and in the person of Jesus experienced that brutality firsthand And He endured it all just to make a way for us to be redeemed and be able to be in relationship with Him I would say He gets it

Abortion in my opinion is one of the few issues where multiple positions can be considered libertarian depending solely on your definition of life If you believe a fetus is a living human then it absolutely has the right to life and the government must protect that fetus right On the other hand if you do not the government has no business saying what you can and cannot do Both of these are libertarian positions

God Will Save Me A terrible storm came into a town and local officials sent out an emergency warning that the riverbanks would soon overflow and flood the nearby homes They ordered everyone in the town to evacuate immediately A faithful Christian man heard the warning and decided to stay saying to himself I will trust God and if I am in danger then God will send a divine miracle to save me The neighbors came by his house and said to him Were leaving and there is room for you in our car please come with us But the man declined I have faith that God will save me As the man stood on his porch watching the water rise up the steps a man in a canoe paddled by and called to him Hurry and come into my canoe the waters are rising quickly But the man again said No thanks God will save me The floodwaters rose higher pouring water into his living room and the man had to retreat to the second floor A police motorboat came by and saw him at the window We will come up and rescue you they shouted But the man refused waving them off saying Use your time to save someone else I have faith that God will save me The flood waters rose higher and higher and the man had to climb up to his rooftop A helicopter spotted him and dropped a rope ladder A rescue officer came down the ladder and pleaded with the man Grab my hand and I will pull you up But the man STILL refused folding his arms tightly to his body No thank you God will save me Shortly after the house broke up and the floodwaters swept the man away and he drowned When in Heaven the man stood before God and asked I put all of my faith in You Why didnt You come and save me And God said Son I sent you a warning I sent you a car I sent you a canoe I sent you a motorboat I sent you a helicopter What more were you looking for

 In the transformationthrougheducation camps life and death do not mean the same thing as they do elsewhere A hundred times over I thought when the footfalls of guards woke us in the night that our time had come to be executed When a hand viciously pushed clippers across my skull and other hands snatched away the tufts of hair that fell on my shoulders I shut my eyes blurred with tears thinking my end was near that I was being readied for the scaffold the electric chair drowning Death lurked in every corner When the nurses grabbed my arm to vaccinate me I thought they were poisoning me In reality they were sterilising us That was when I understood the method of the camps the strategy being implemented not to kill us in cold blood but to make us slowly disappear So slowly that no one would notice This is just incredibly sad EDIT Thank you for the gold kind stranger
