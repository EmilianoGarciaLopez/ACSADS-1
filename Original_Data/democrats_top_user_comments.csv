"Hi. Our motivation for this came about after studying a phenomenon that occurs in dynamical systems theory called a saddle-node or fold bifurcation. Basically, two equilibrium points are ""created"" via the variation of some parameters in the dynamical system. We recognized after looking at Einstein's equations, that under certain cosmological conditions (spatially flat FLRW), these equations have the same form as a fold bifurcation, hence, by varying the cosmological constant are current universe can be shown to *emerge* via the varying of this constant through a fold bifurcation.

Long ago when I was a youngster, my dad was in a massive car crash (more like he was crashed into by two cars) and it broke his body in more ways than I can recount here.  Over the decades, he never ever got over it.  Physically or mentally.  The accident took away the life he had on all levels.  In his thinking and in discussion, his whole life is framed as either ""before the accident"" or ""after the accident"".  ""The Accident"" is, tragically, the single biggest life shaping event of his life other than, I'm going to posit, his birth and the birth of his kids.  Even decades later, on the anniversary of the night of his car accident, his legs cramp up and he feels on edge all around.  

Trauma is carved deep into the body, the nerves, the mind and the soul.

"This is Cannikin, the largest underground nuclear test by the United States... it took place in Alaska in 1971, a 5 megaton device.

[The YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtH0EDLcbwA)

From the description:

*Cannikin was detonated on November 6, Amchitka island, Alaska, 1971, as the thirteenth test of the Operation Grommet (1971--1972) underground nuclear test series. The announced yield was 5 megatons (21 PJ) -- the largest underground nuclear test in US history. (Estimates for the precise yield range from 4.4 to 5.2 megatons or 18 to 22 PJ). The ground lifted 20 feet (6 m), caused by an explosive force almost 400 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb. Subsidence and faulting at the site created a new lake, over a mile wide. The explosion caused a seismic shock of 7.0 on the Richter scale, causing rockfalls and turf slides of a total of 35,000 square feet (3,300 m2). Though earthquakes and tsunamis predicted by environmentalists did not occur, a number of small tectonic events did occur in the following weeks, (some registering as high as 4.0 on the richter scale) thought to be due to the interaction of the explosion with local tectonic stresses.*"

They knew they didn't do it, but they couldn't say that some of the people they were paying for, or training, or otherwise were working with, decided to flip and shoot the President.

At a press conference on Monday, Decatur Police Chief Nate Allen acknowledged that the responding officer, who has not been named, punched Penn because he thought he was the shoplifter. Penn suffered a broken jaw, had his teeth knocked out and needed to get his mouth wired shut as a result, according to his lawyer Carl Cole.

"Everything clearly points to the step father of having something to do with this disappearance of Katelin. It seems incredible that after four long years the police can't seem to solve this and it seems to have turned into yet another cold case. The police have also stated they have not had any contact with the step dad in over two years which seems even more surprising. I think the cherry on the cake of this whole investigation is this statement from the police 'it is possible that Katelin hasn’t met with foul play, and had ran away'. No wonder so many cases are never solved.   "
"A motorist claims he was looking for a fishing spot in Grayson County when a gunman stopped his vehicle and began to verbally attack him. In the video the man can be heard saying: 'I didn't know this was your house.' The man replied: 'Yeah, you f******g did too.' He then points his gun through the window and says: 'You're gonna end up f******g dead. That's what's fixin' to happen to you.'

"Thank you for taking the time to read, it is a long story but very interesting. I was wondering about her other two husbands myself. Another question I have is why, was it for financial gain? And what happened to Thomas's body!?"
I hope the dog made it out alive.
It is wonderful to see another cold case murder solved. It is esp pleasing the police did not forget about it because of the age. At least this will bring some measure of closure to the family.

Stephanie Rapkin 64, a probate lawyer from the suburban Milwaukee town of Shorewood, Wisconsin, was arrested on Saturday for spitting on Eric Patrick Lucas, 17. Rapkin parked her car in the middle of the street blocking a protest by hundreds of locals in Shorewood on Saturday afternoon. According to authorities, a Black Lives Matter march was heading south on North Oakland Avenue when Rapkin left her car in the middle of the intersection of East Jarvis Street and North Oakland Avenue so as to obstruct the procession. Rapkin is then seen walking on the sidewalk and confronting a large group of protesters, most of whom appeared to be in their teens and 20s. Rapkin then spits on the boy. Other protesters crowd around her, urging her to return to her vehicle."

"Not surprised but sad and disappointed. The problem is lots of Asians who are not Chinese don’t believe Trump is talking about them. Even Taiwanese who are Chinese don’t believe they are because they are a separate country. The thing that has stuck with me the most that my mom told me when I was young was that- even if you forget your heritage, non Asians will never see you as anything else but Asian based on your eyes and facial features. The Republicans (164 members of Congress) voted against the resolution denouncing hate incidents towards Asian Americans during the pandemic. Only a pathetic 14 members of the House voted yes. Frequently, I am asked the gambit of what I am before they guess the right one, are you Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese? I have news for the people who think that just because you are not Chinese, you are safe from discrimination. The racists who listen to Trump about the Kung flu and want to smash your face in, aren’t going to ask you if you are Chinese first. If you have any Asian features, to them, you are fair game."

You can track it in on your shoes. Lots of vets recommend not getting another puppy until you know your home or yard are free of the virus. Lastly and most important, have the vet contact the parvo vaccine manufacturer. If their vaccine didn’t work and they can trace it back they are responsible for your vet bills.  There have been people who reported that their puppy got parvo while fully vaccinated and it turns out that the vaccine failed. Again, so sorry for your loss!"

They need to be arrested for harassment. This is ridiculous.

Huma Abedin borrowed her husband's laptop to send emails to Hillary Clinton sometimes.  His laptop was seized as evidence for an investigation into his sending sexually explicit photos to a minor.  (It was apparently not a cell phone as previously thought.)

All her emails to Clinton are being checked now that they have them.  The investigation is not being reopened because it was never closed because of freedom of information requests (I don't understand this part, but that's what's being reported.

"Great news.  This means conference committee needs to actually write a bill, which means the Freedom Caucus's attempt to kill the deals that got Collins on board actually matters and AARP is going to be lobbying her (as the senator from the most elderly state in the union) very hard.  

It also means government shutdown will probably be a separate showdown from the pay-as-you-go waiver since they have only 2-3 days left to prevent that and the legislative calendar is going to be very tight.

"After the first week of refunds were down 8%, Republican lawmakers (quite rightly) argued it was too soon to panic considering the IRS literally was just getting started issuing them after Trump's shutdown. 

A month in and the amount refunds have shrunk has more than doubled to 17%.  It's time for Republican lawmakers to **panic**, this is the political equivalent of lighting themselves on fire.  A much smaller refund or owing on taxes makes a bigger impression than a small increase in take-home pay. "

"Eh...

When he was younger Keith Ellison really did hold some extremely questionable views, including defending some anti-Semites.  I'm neither black, white, nor Jewish and as an outsider looking at his writings, his early views on splitting the US into separate countries for the races are odious and hypocritical to me.  I also happen to be roughly around the age he would have been as a law student and I know I would never have written anything like that.  Hell, I've been published with virtually the opposite sentiment in various (grown-up) newspapers.  

He has denounced his younger self's views, saying they were due to ignorance rather than hate.  I do think the right wing media hasn't been fair in their interpretation of his most recent statements, but I also don't entirely absolve Ellison of responsibility for two reasons: 

1. You're an adult by the time you're in grad school, even if you're a man. By the last two years of law school, you should know better.  You should just be a bigger person than that by your mid-twenties.  
2. If you really grasp how bad what you wrote as a young man was, you'd never, ever talk about those issues in inflammatory terms again.  Instead, he's made statements that opens himself up to these attacks, clearly revealing a profound lack of sensitivity if nothing else.    

It's not like I disagree with him on some of the Israel issues, but with his history he should have been much more careful about how he said things.  

Edit: Thanks for gold.  People have been asking for links to his writings so I tried to choose one that's from a relatively neutral or even liberal source.  [This is the school newspaper that actually published some of his early writings](http://www.mndaily.com/article/2016/11/ellisons-push-for-dnc-chair-brings-to-light-old-columns).  

You can see he has a pretty well-developed intellect already (he should, he's an upperclassmen law student).  Hell, I agree with him on affirmative action, but he's basically advocating black nationalism instead of a real solution.  To fully understand how bad this is from the point of view of Jewish civil rights, you have to also read the writings of Farrakahn himself.  "
"  I would guess based on the reference to disinfectants that it was ammonium compounds like you find in Lysol.  These are safe to use because they break down quickly, I could easily imagine that spraying them into the air and inhaling them before they do get the time to break down could cause serious problems.  Natural cleaners often also contain chemicals like ethanol or volatile fragrances so they might not necessarily be any better.  

Probably best to apply chemicals to the surface being cleaned and not into the air. Also probably best not to mix chemicals or buy products that do.  For example, detergents with bleach can release carcinogens even though plain household bleach and the same detergents used separately do not, I bet there are more cases like this.  

The article was sketch though IMO, what was that weird product plug at the end?  For all the info the article gives, it was caustic lye like contained in oven cleaner they were talking about. "
"1. The emails seem to be from Huma Abedin's ~~phone~~ as part of an investigation into her husband Anthony Weiner's sexting to a 15-year-old.  It's now being reported that the new emails are actually from *Weiner's* laptop, which Abedin used sometimes to send emails to Clinton. 
2. The FBI has to inform congress that there is new information
3. Jason Chaffetz is the one who use the language ""reopen"". The investigation is not being reopened as it was not closed.  "
"Oliver Wendell Holmes said 'taxes are the price of civilization.' All of the 'I did it my way' fantasists ignore the impact of government investment on their lives because it contradicts their self-serving internal narrative. And politicians are often the worst. 

For instance, wing-nut Florida Congressman Allen West has been living off government support his entire life: education, career etc - all government paid - and yet makes a handsome living decrying the system that gave him a chance. 

These pull up the ladder after them types will be the first to demand government support - again - after their policies create crises severe enough to negatively impact even their well-cushioned lives."
"Hmm. CEO of company charged with largest fraud ever perpetrated against the US government then attempts to perpetrate fraud to ensure the re-election of his party. Gosh, how did Florida voters never see this coming..."
Agreed. Hiding behind media placement companies is a ridiculous excuse and one they should know will never stand up to scrutiny
"Employees and consultants can both have relevant and useful observations to make. The problem, traditionally, has come when senior management ignores its own employees in favor of the consultants."
"People tend to support that criteria that play to their strengths and give them an advantage them while criticizing the criteria that they perceive to put them at a disadvantage. Many of those attacking race as a criteria may well support others in which they do well (SAT, ACT, athletic scholarships, legacy admissions). It is also worth noting that race and ethnicity were originally highlighted to overcome both bigotry and economic impacts which weakened society as a whole. To the extent that those conditions persist, it is self serving to suggest that admissions criteria be radically changed, especially since some of the assaults on race and ethnicity are being led by other ethnic groups now demanding their own advantages. The outcomes are significant, which is why the battle is so fierce"
"Rick Scott was CEO of the company that perpetrated the largest fraud against the US government IN ITS ENTIRE HISTORY. His board was forced to dismiss him but he was clever enough to never be convicted of the crime. Moral bearing? Whatever he wants is reason enough for him. He spouts a lot of rhetoric about the integrity of the voting process. But this is just hard core politics: encourage your own voters, deny your opponents theirs. The Repubs know their message isnt resonating with voters. And how could it? To succeed, voters have to screw themselves. Plan B - which was there all along - is simply to keep as many from the polls as possible. And, by the way, they feel just fine about this. They are still pissed about JFK and Dick Daley stealing the election in 1960 and they arent going to forgive or forget."
"A billion here, a billion there...

The reaction has less to do with the amount than that it reinforces the lesson learned in 2008 that the banks, for all their arrogant self-assurance (Jamie Dimon, first and foremost) do not really understand the financial implications of these trades. Which makes their opposition to transparency and regulation all the more shameful and dangerous. One can only hope that there will be no bailout for JPM if this gets even worse - though the bank's 'investment' in public policy was insurance for just such a moment. We'll see if it pays off - or if sanity reasserts itself."
"Exactly. And with Fox News trumpeting his musings as if they were the truth, the 40% of the electorate who rely on Fox for their views will fall into line, even as their own economic well-being is shattered. And after that happens, McConnell and Fox will blame liberal policies for the result. Yet another reason why this election is so important. "
The inheritance is less significant than the sense of entitlement that comes from being born into that unacknowledged web of privilege.
Just as the Republican tax reduction plan intended
Practical advice. You cant fix a mistake if you dont first own up to it. 
The Romney campaign has declared they will not permit their strategy to be dictated by 'fact checkers.' This fall campaign period and the resultant election will be an interesting test to see whether American voters buy the Repubs BS or go with the Dems truths. 
"The Bain attacks appear to be working for Obama which is why his campaign continues them - and why the Romney campaign is screaming bloody murder. Whatever Romney says, the data square with the experiences of every American who worked for a business taken over by private equity or leveraged buy-out firms. Truth hurts. "
"That the government of the country with the largest population on earth can effectively dictate the behavior of its citizens, rewarding or punishing as it sees fit, indicates the threat posed by such technologies, especially to democracies where fear and ignorance have increased demand for a 'strong leader.' "
"If tax cuts which screwed most of the population of the United States and enriched a limited number of already ultra wealthy conservatives are the only reason you were able to expand your business and hire more employees, then you've got much bigger problems than the prospect of a tax increase. "
"NYC is scared shitless about the loss of financial sector jobs and tax revenue. It has been the engine driving the gravy train for a generation now, including Mayor Bloomberg's own wealth. On top of that, the hedgies, bankers and private equity people have used their power to build a nice, safe little play city for themselves and dont want anyone taking it away. The cops are also seeing their force downsized and know the revenue to pay their $50K + salaries comes from the aforementioned financial sector, realize that jobs in construction are not what they were, so also fear the de-financialization steamroller. Understanding your opponents fears may help to outwit or overpower them. In any event, the tides of history are pulling against their continued hegemony."
"All very nice, but let's keep in mind that the thrill is gone. The reputational benefits have become deficits, the bonus pool is down and regulatory oversight is more stringent. One can imagine that the added pressure to make more from what may be a shrinking pool has probably turned some of the internal sharks even more vicious. A good time to go. But leaving five years ago would have been more of a statement."
"I agree about the small contractors. But thanks to right wing propaganda, people forget that many federal employees are not that well paid, especially in expensive urban areas. This is going to bite. And while Trump has already claimed that most of those hurt 'are Democrats,' it was (another) patently false statement that may become reality since he and his backers could care less about what happens to anyone besides themselves and federal workers, especially in the south, west and rural areas, will be voting in two years. "
"Scott was forced to back off when it became known that the company that won the contract to do the testing was owned by his wife. But open bidding was only instituted when he was embarrassed publicly by that revelation. The problem now is that despite his unpopularity, the Dems have no obvious candidate to take him on. 

Re his unpopularity, some judicial candidates running against sitting judges in Florida this year are finding one of the themes that polls very well is saying if they are elected they will serve longer than Rick Scott can so that he will be denied the ability to appoint a successor if they die or resign before their terms are up. "
"I dont disagree with your description of the technical trading activity. But I do think that not 'understanding the financial implications' covers a broader set of issues: Dimon was reassured by his own risk managers that there was not a problem. Presumably they knew there was a problem but thought they could fix it before they got caught. One of the reasons they couldn't was that word about 'the London Whale' leaked way before anyone knew what that meant, but it brought in the other traders and placed constraints on JPM's ability to act. So, the implications are not just tied to the trade itself but to bureaucratic processes to which all organizations are subject and which they can not always control. In addition, Dimon's very public posturing on regulation assured that whenever something went wrong, the reaction would be exacerbated by those simply taking advantage piling on along with those aching to embarass the bank while making a few bucks in the process. Remember that Lehman, Bear, RBS and every other institution caught with problems also thought they had a way to limit the damage. In an interconnected economy in which transparency, reputation and perception get thrown into the mix, the implications are not always well understood or controllable.  "

And, Trump was so busy dealing with his own *'awful natural disasters'*, that he didn't have time to even notice the earthquake & hurricane that hit our neighbor?  He must be easily overwhelmed. 

There is nothing *'perfectly understandable'*, as you say, about any of this.

> The emails, which Miller sent to the conservative website Breitbart News in 2015 and 2016, showcase the extremist, anti-immigrant ideology that undergirds the policies he has helped create as an architect of Donald Trump’s presidency. These policies include reportedly setting arrest quotas for undocumented immigrants, an executive order effectively banning immigration from five Muslim-majority countries and a policy of family separation at refugee resettlement facilities that the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General said is causing “intense trauma” in children.

> In this, the first of what will be a series about those emails, Hatewatch exposes the racist source material that has influenced Miller’s visions of policy. That source material, as laid out in his emails to Breitbart, includes white nationalist websites, a “white genocide”-themed novel in which Indian men rape white women, xenophobic conspiracy theories and eugenics-era immigration laws that Adolf Hitler lauded in “Mein Kampf.”

According to the article, Miller used his government email address when he was an aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions to send the majority of those emails.

At the time, Miller was Session's Communication Director so those emails would have been sent from a senate.gov-type email address.

>In 2005, Trump borrowed $640 million from a group of banks, including Deutsche Bank, to build his Chicago tower. But by 2008, the real estate market had gone bad, and Trump was in financial trouble. Shortly before he was due to pay Deutsche Bank $40 million for a portion of the loan he had personally guaranteed, Trump filed a lawsuit against the German bank, demanding $3 billion to compensate him for the international economic turmoil that Trump claimed the bank had helped cause and that Trump now said was hurting his investment in Chicago.

>Deutsche Bank, the struggling financial giant that is Donald Trump’s biggest lender, anointed a new CEO, a longtime executive named Christian Sewing. He’s worked in a number of roles at the bank, but what’s significant about his résumé is the job he held prior to his promotion: He oversaw the firm’s private bank, the division that caters to high-net-worth clients and has loaned Trump’s company hundreds of millions of dollars over the years, when few lenders (including Deutsche Bank’s own commercial lending arm) would do business with the bankruptcy-prone businessman.

>...we disclosed how FBME’s ultra-powerful international law firms – including an attorney playing a key role in the Trump-Russia investigation – crusaded for the bank while accountants at two of the world’s biggest accounting firms signed off its activities, and we exposed a network of Kremlin-linked slush funds inside FBME funnelling money to shadowy people fronting for Syria's chemical weapons programme, organised crime, and ISIS.

"I'm a healthcare worker, got covid from a fellow employee that was exposed but didn't quarantine and mask up. She still came to work. I was informed by our employee health department that I needed a test. This was several days after she exposed me. I tested positive Dec. 2020, my wife Dec. 2020. She is  diabetic. Thankfully we both had the monoclonal antibody treatment (experimental treatment). Even with that I was giving us constant breathing treatments. We would both wake up and while the other was sleeping was putting a pulse oximeter on each other to get oxygen saturation while the other was asleep. Our 02 sats dropped as low as 90% we would encourage each other to breath. We knew that if one of us went to the hospital they would not come back.( that's when it seemed like everyone that went to the hospital was intubated and would die). Neither one of us felt like we could go on without the other (36yrs of marriage) and if one of us died it would be at home with someone that loves you, holding you. We had these actual conversations. Thankfully (not with gods help) we both recovered slowly but surely. I was out of work until the end of February (that's when my employer stopped furlough payments). So, I lied to my personal MD and said I felt about 85% back to normal when actually it was about 55%. I struggled to walk from my car to the building. Today I'm actually about 80%. Long covid is just as real as covid. My wife works from home but neither of us are really back to normal. We both feel like this disease took about 20yrs off our lives. We lost 20yrs and came closer to death then I've ever been(my job puts me at risk of dieing nearly every day, I fly on medical  helicopter). Because one person didn't think it was a big deal. Masks and vaccines saves lives. When I see ""healthcare workers"" shit all over masks and vaccines I take it personal and can't help but think, what kind of healthcare professional are they. Every treatment is experimental, until it's not. I've known hundreds of people who got vaccinated and not one of them had any side effects other then the feeling shitty for a day.  I've seen many, many people die not vaccinated. Its simple math people. This is one of those moments in history when people will look back and say ""why didn't they just take a shot and wear a mask to avoid all the heartache what dumb asses""
Sorry, but that's my soapbox, and although it took me 30mins to get my thoughts together to say these things I had to say them. It's a struggle every day.

"Why is anyone still surprised by anything the GOP does or says, we had 4 years of bigotry, division, intolerance and sheer hatred for anyone that has a difference of opinion. As soon we all stop being surprised by the GOP and call them ALL for what they are the sooner we can fix the problem. It's too late for the average Republican to say I'm a Republican and I dont agree with my party. If you are still in the GOP, you are now part of the problem.

"The takeaway that ""identity politics"" and ""social justice"" are **detracting** from studying, reflecting on, or even the urgency to prevent another Holocaust, is such **sloppy thinking**. It is simply ***ahistorical*** to try to equate the moral urgency of Holocaust remembrance with anti-SJW/anti-PC/anti-IDPol stances, I hardly know where to begin.

First, Hitler and other high-up members of the Nazi intelligentsia **grounded** their call for the Holocaust in the idea of ""purifying"" Germany of minority non-Aryan blood. **That's a f@cking identity right there: ""Aryan"" identity""**.

The Nazis' **whole game** was dressed up in identity politics.

Grasping this fact is **not** the same thing as saying that all identities therefore should be **abolished** from ""SJW or ""PC culture"". Know why?

**Because identity politics was also appealed to by peoole who saw the Holocaust as a moral travesty**.

**The appeal to moral urgency to protect minorities from persecution, and recognizing minorities' unique and legitimate contributions and participation in society is identity politics**

In fact, many anti-Nazi activists and many anti-Nazi intellectualls pointed to the assimilation of many prominent German Jewish intellectuals as why more Germans did not feel obligated to protect Jewish contributions to German culture or German society. 

The thinking goes that Hitler and the Nazis were able to vilify the Jews ***precisely*** because they could demagogue that the German Jews themselves were ""slipping under the radar"" of German society in a covert plot to replace German culture with Jewish culture. 

The Nazis took this hesitation to defend their Jewish identity as a leigitmate way to participate in German society as proof that they were engaged in a nefarious secret anti-Aryan plot.

Peterson himself and many of his supporters fundamentally misunderstand the conceptual history of identity politics (**i.e., how the concept was used in many different ways**). 

And it is due to this misunderstanding that they open themselves up to the fallacy: **""Well, the Nazis used identity politics, so SJW identity politics inevitably leads to the same thing.""**

They mistake the **category** of identity politics for the **promotion** of certain identities over others, i.e., the **characteristics** of certain **types** of identity politics. They fundamentally misunderstand that **not all identity politics are the same thing**. They **conflate** the **category** with **characteristics** or the **container** for its **content**, if this makes sense."
"Btw, this is a **perfect** example of why the techno-libertarian ""unschooling"" movement needs to get schooled: Thinking that slavery can ever be reinvented as new **and/or** innovative is historically, sociologically, and civically **illiterate.**"
"We need to expand the concept of work-life balance to fathers instead of only conceiving work-life issues as only affecting women and/or mothers. We should also start extending the conversation over family leave policies to fathers as well.

What do you think?"
">and seeing Peterson address them directly to her face would be interesting.

This was a particularly violent excerpt. It's almost laughable how much these lobster fanboys insist on being deliberately obtuse regarding the concept of emotional labor when it comes to respecting others' boundaries, but ***totally*** get the concept when it applies to them."
"I find it ludicrous and appalling that he filibusters and then settles on an ambigious pander. ***Particularly*** because **he made his popularity off of strident moralistic rejections of cultural and political norms he finds to be bullshit.**

**Where is that same strident rejection here?**

Did he not claim several times that the impetus for his moral crusade was studying the Nazis and the Holocaust?!

Or does he simply think that the BS idea that the Nazis were left-wing ***not*** BS after all?!

Because if he doesn't think that calling the Nazis left-wing is ludicrous, he should probably return his PhD."

"It might be a topic not commonly discussed on their sub, but then I would be surprised if they don't have a rule that suggests ""**transgender does not qualify as transhuman**,"" a rule I'd think is ***very weird***. I might not be the best acquainted with transhumanism, but saying the transgender community does not qualify as valued discussants in the transhumanist community seems... very much trapped in **""traditional"" human biases**.

Perhaps they mistakenly believe the transgender community still assumes **the category of gender** and perhaps this comes off as assuming that too much of human sexuality is correct and ***not to be transcended***?

Though, this wouldn't make much sense to me; ***many*** self-ID'd transhumanists I know of self-ID as heteronormative and/or heterosexual, so those particular people ***definitely*** do assume **binary** sex differences and **binary** gender signifiers."

Do you need to have ties to the Mayflower to know that the Confederacy was a seditious bunch of traitors fighting to preserve slavery?
Watch the documentary on Shelby. Ford owned the name Cobra from deals with Carol Shelby and it had the Shelby name to sell it. He was an American legend. Shelby took Mustangs and made them race cars for sale to the public.
That 13th Amendment loophole.
If you need to go back over 60 years to show how you aren't the bad guys today you are the bad guys.
"I liked it, not that those old episodes weren't fantastic and you can always watch them again. The idea of, pick what ever you want and meet in Madagascar was a good one. I would, just once see one of them, Clarkson most likely, just show up with a damn Range Rover and be done with it. 

""To prepare for these grueling conditions we just found out about I put on a set of more sturdy all season tires and pretty much went anywhere."" Laughing at May in his jacked up Panda and Richard in a Mustang with a brush bar."
"Filibusters should be like challenges in the NFL, you get two every 6 months."
The absolute worst part is that they think they are being clever.
"Don’t worry, when the GOP make it impossible for average people to go bankrupt you will never have to worry about it again. Enjoy the bus and studio apartment."
"When I get back to my CAMP with a load of them from whatever I take off all my armor and outfits, stand on my second story porch and just huck them around like a good West Virginian."
Why would anyone share this?
Seems like a reasonable fellow.
What in the 2007 is going on here!
"Amongst other things, if KNOWING Russia had bounties on US soldiers isn't treason and traitorous. Then what is? I think that should have been the line for these dumbasses!"

"It’s an organized mess, with no signs of vermin."
You have to be a complete fucking psychopath to kill someone’s pet.
We feel lucky to have been in the right place at the right time!
"Yes! This is why Medicare for all, universal pre-k, raising the minimum wage, etc are all crucial for improving so many people’s health!"
There are still so many homes with Trump flags in my community. I really hope they start to come down but I doubt it.
It’s definitely been a lifelong dream of mine! I have been an animal lover since I was born. My daughter is the same.

"Well, I mean, she’s not wrong."
"Yep, this is a vet issue. It’s very unlikely to be behavioral at this age."
"Exactly this. Dogs who are staring at another animal are not doing it because they are jealous. Dogs do not work that way. This behavior is very concerning, and imo needs the help of a professional certifies trainer."
The way the body was left certainly sounds like the killer wanted to humiliate her. I wonder if she had recently rejected anyone...
Thank you! We feel pretty lucky.

I actually really like James Corden. He’s pretty well liked in the UK and has been on some good shows. Seems like a decent dude.

"Sounds like some cherry-picking here as to who he is considering to be a “high-profile appointee”. Biden has appointed several Black people, and I’m not aware of any of them being Jewish. Also I know for a fact that Deb Haaland (Interior Secretary nominee) is Catholic.

Not to mention the handle “Syndrome Of A Down” is super cringy in its own right."
"The sig at the bottom right is of M. Rasheed, who is actually black and vocally against racism. So, either he intended this cartoon to be satirical, or (more likely) somebody changed the words in the speech bubbles and added the watermelon. Rasheed has attracted the attention of 4chan trolls (who have dubbed him the “black Ben Garrison”), so it sure seems like he’s getting Garrisoned here."
"It does seem strange that the numbers 3, 5, and 12 appear so often in these equations and no other numbers do. I don’t know if that’s supposed to reference anything or not. I’m willing to bet this cartoonist wasn’t a skilled mathematician, though."
"Update: they replied to me saying this pic “likely doesn’t violate their community guidelines”.

Which, if nothing else, just goes to show that her underlying point that she has been hammering for the past few days (that tech companies are omnipotent leftist tyrants hellbent on shutting down any remotely conservative viewpoints) is, shall we say, _false_."
“Europids”. Now there’s one I haven’t seen before.
"There was supposedly a traditional creation myth from some culture (forgot which one but it might have been Ethiopia) that was pretty much like this; God overcooked the first batch of humans, undercooked the second (i.e. white people), and the third came out “just right”.

Edit: looked it up. Yes it was Ethiopia: see https://japansociology.com/2014/12/02/mythologies-of-skin-color-and-race-in-ethiopia/"
"Obviously the last panel was edited, but I’m not sure what the original was. A cigarette maybe?"
"Garrett Foster was married or engaged (sources differ) to Whitney Mitchell, who herself has been [targeted by Internet racists](https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/a-dallas-mom-is-trying-to-take-down-chimpmaniacom-after-site-targets-quadruple-amputee-daughter-7141825) in the past."
"Yeah. This kind of thing would be the equivalent of a 9 year old girl wearing a padded leopard-print bikini in front of straight guys. Which, sad to say, sometimes happens as well although folks like the Doge-man don’t ever seem to notice or care. Even some of the stuff that goes on at child beauty pageants is pretty iffy."
"Converting to Christianity would have done absolutely nothing to protect you from the Nazis, since they defined Jewishness in terms of ancestry. To the Nazis, a Jew who converts to any other religion was still a Jew. There was even a fairly well-known Catholic nun (whose name I forget) who was killed in a concentration camp because she was ethnically Jewish. So this book doesn’t even get that right.

As for the bit about “success” at the end, perhaps it was supposed to be a reference to Calvinism and its much-touted work ethic? (Look up Max Weber to see what I mean)."
How stupid do you have to be to post racist comments under your own name on _LinkedIn_ of all places.
I wonder if this cartoon was the first time where white women who date black men have been depicted with black eyes. That has sort of become a meme among racists in recent years (they use the term “coalburner sunglasses”).
I can smell the straw from here.
"How long before the 4channers start claiming the officers were good boys, didn’t do nothing, and have been going to church every week trying to get their lives back on track?"
"Couldn’t you say the exact same think about Republicans? 

If anything, Western Europeans seem to be closer to the U.S. Democrats than the Republicans in terms of their average political leaning, so it would make more sense to suggest that a Republican is the one spreading COVID here. Our Republicans have more in common with Eastern Europe (Hungary, Serbia, etc.) and with Brazil (where a Trump clone is in charge and the virus is spreading like wildfire)."
"Yeah. It’s Nick “A. Wyatt Mann” Bougas. This is definitely one of his tamer ones, as it doesn’t feature any of the grotesque racial/ethnic stereotypes he usually draws, just a pathetic-looking blond kid."
"Don’t you mean C? There are many cultures where it is common to [consume cats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_meat) and [dogs as food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_meat) (especially the latter). On the other hand, giving a child 50 lashes for stealing candy sounds totally insane to me."
"The guy on the right looks familiar. While driving through Georgia on vacation, my dad and I passed [a store](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-rebel-shop-clayton) that uses him as a mascot."
Rockthrow retweeted it. Because of course he did.
"I honestly don’t know. This is one of those awful attempts at humor that literally has no punchline.

At first I thought the equations must be wrong and that the cartoonist was implying Black people were bad at math. But it turns out those are polynomials and the solution is not given (meaning it would be up to the student to solve for x). So there seems to be no point to this drawing other than cheap stereotyping."
"I started college at 35, never having take a class.  In May, I’ll graduate with a masters at the age of 41.  I feel all of this.  Haha "

I kissed my wife right on midnight and she was like, “there’s still 20 seconds left!”  I said, “do you think they’d have those two on TV all night without some kinda of delay just in case?”"
"This is news!  Guys!  Sanders just said he's the best candidate!  Get this in the front page of Reddit, STAT!!"
"Our biggest loss was due to the removing of the moving write-offs.  We moved from Dallas to DC because I got a job.  Even my father-in-law, a staunch Republican, had no idea that Trump had removed that portion, and kept encouraging me with “hey.  It’s more to write off!” every time I had to spend money during the move.  Starting this year, you can only write off a move if you’re military.  "
"Can we put the FBI on Bill Mitchell?  Seriously.  This is just one of his tweets.  Search “from:@michellvii fauci” in the Twitter search box and see how obsessed he is.  And his thousands and thousands of followers eat it up:

"So in summary, Sinead thought (as we all did) that Miley is extremely talented and that the industry was sexualizing her and making her do dumb shit... only to find out that Miley is talented, but is also a dumb shit.  "

"Most conservative Christians are single issue voters. They will never not believe that abortion is murder, and if Satan himself said that he would abolish abortion, they would lick his nutsack."

">Video of the Loveland Police Department booking area shows the officers who made the arrest, Austin Hopp and Daria Jalali, re-watching body camera footage and laughing about the incident while the woman, Karen Garner, sat handcuffed to a bench in a nearby cell.  
>  
>The officers fractured Garner’s arm and dislocated her shoulder during the arrest, her family has said.  
>  
>[“Ready for the pop?”](https://youtu.be/1iuuyg94-yI?t=2906) an officer identified by Garner’s lawyer as Hopp said to other officers while re-watching the body camera footage together.

>“What popped?” another officer asked.  
>  
>“I think it was her shoulder,” Hopp responded.

>In the video from the booking area, Hopp can also be heard saying, “I can’t believe I threw a 73-year-old on the ground,” and saying he loved watching the body camera footage of his fight with the elderly woman.

They are 100% hunting for sport and entertainment.

Edit: The article also mentions multiple cops *refusing to give the victim medical treatment*

>Schielke on Monday added two more officers — Tyler Blackett and Antolina Hill — as defendants in the lawsuit, alleging they knew Garner was injured but did not provide her medical care while she was held in the booking cell. The federal lawsuit alleges Garner did not receive medical care for more than six hours after her arrest.

"He was 14 years old when he was executed in an electric chair. During his trial, he always carried a Bible in his hands claiming his innocence. He was accused of killing two white girls, 11 year old Betty and Mary of 7 whose bodies were found near the house the boy and his parents lived. At that time, all members of the jury were whites. The trial lasted 2 hours only and the sentence was dictated 10 minutes later.

The boy's parents were not allowed in the court room, and subsequently expelled from that city after the trial.

Before the execution, George spent 81 days in prison without being able to see his parents. He was held in solitary 80 miles from his city, he was held alone without anybody to talk to. and was electrocuted with 5380 volts in his head.

70 years later, in 2014, his innocence was finally proven by a judge in South Carolina."

"Then finally I hear “the head is out! STOP PUSHING!!” Apparently he had his cord very tightly around his neck. They couldn’t slide it off so they had to cut it right there (goodbye delayed cord clamping). That took a few minutes to figure out, and then I gave one more good push and he came out. One thing that was crazy to me was that once I was ready for the final push, the nurse reached up and whipped down the top of my hospital gown to get my boobs out and ready.    

First of all, the feeling of relief when he was out was AMAZING. I don’t know how to describe it. Like the weight of the world had been lifted. I audibly sighed.   

They placed him on my chest. For like a millisecond. Because of the cord around his neck, he was not really responsive and needed more than skin to skin (RIP final element of birth plan). This part was very scary for my husband. I was aware of what was happening but I could also see the reflection of the doc stitching me up in the reflection on his face shield so I was a little distracted. Apparently they called extra nurses in to revive him (or vive him, since he was alive just struggling a bit). It really freaked my husband out. But I couldn’t really see what was going on so I was not as nervous. What I could see what the reflection of my vagina in the doc’s surgical mask as he was stitching me up - and that made me nervous, haha.   

I had a 2nd degree tear, but it was all internal so I haven’t felt any pain really since then. I also didn’t get hemorrhoids (score!). I was very scared of the delivery process but everything turned out fine (as fine as it could I guess).   

We are all home now and doing well. Breastfeeding is hard, but we’re trying. Not sleeping is hard, but I just look at his little face and my heart wants to explode!"

"Sorry if this is long. I did love reading these while I was pregnant and I’m excited to write my own.   

The moral of this story is that no matter your plan (and even if you’re like me and think you don’t have a plan) it will probably not happen. But now I’m in recovery and just smitten with this adorable little baby. 

All I really wanted was a 39w induction and an epidural. I didn’t plan much for birth beyond that. In the hospital where I delivered it’s standard for them to do delayed cord clamping and immediate skin to skin, so I didn’t feel like I had to add those to a plan. In the end I only got one of those things, and that just barely. 

38+3 and I notice a significant drop in the baby’s movement. So we go to L&D to get checked. On the NST they notice I’m having contractions every 8-10 mins, but I can’t feel a thing. They checked to see if I was dilated at all but nada. I was really hoping for something because it would be great if I made progress without feeling a thing. But it was not to be.   

On 39w exactly is when I was scheduled for the induction. I waited all day for a call about what time to come in but didn’t hear anything. I called around 3 and they told me 7-7:30 but they’d call back to confirm. Never heard back so I called around 6:30 and they said they were super busy but they’d call back in a few hours. Don’t hear anything until 9:30 and they say maybe midnight. Right around midnight, I start noticing contractions and I think “hm, I guess this kid knows he’s scheduled to come out and he’s trying to get the jump on me.” I talked to the charge nurse at 12:30a and she said that it could be a few more hours. I had the option of a call as soon as a bed opened or waiting for the morning shift. We decided to get a call as soon as there was an opening because who knows what will happen if we miss that chance.   

I decide to try to get some sleep because I don’t believe that they’re going to call in “a few” hours. I think it’ll be 4 or 5, at the earliest. My husband wants to stay up. Whatever. That’s his choice, though I think it’s a bad one. I’m also noticing that these contractions are not slowing down so I start timing them. They’re at least a minute long but happening between 9-15 minutes. Cool, nothing to worry about. I get in bed around 1:30 and try to sleep. But damn, these contractions are hitting pretty close together. I try to time them, but I’m half falling asleep when they start and can’t really work my phone. Husband comes to bed around 2:30 and immediately falls asleep. I hate him and think about waking him up because I’m jealous. He starts snoring. I think about killing him. At 3:30 I decide laboring next to a buzz saw in the dark sucks and I get up and get dressed. I also get a snack.   

My whole birth plan had been induction and epidural. I haven’t taken one non-medicated birthing class so laboring in my kitchen kind of sucks. I do yoga breathing, I drop a lot of f-bombs. Are these low intensity contractions? Walking around feels alright. Every contraction makes me ponder the word “bearable.” I suppose anything can be bearable if you don’t die in the middle of it. By 4, the contractions are 6 minutes apart. I’m glad I got some books on audible earlier in the week because I don’t feel like watching tv or listening to music (side note: highly recommend Bad Blood, the book about Theranos. You may be in labor, but at least you’re not a psycho who defrauded people out of billions. Perspective...).   

I keep expecting the contractions to stop. They don’t. They get closer together. By the time they reach 5 mins apart, I wake my husband, which is like waking a bear in hibernation. Luckily, women in labor are scary and he jumps right up. We drive to the hospital and I wonder if he’s trying to hit every pothole on the way there. More thoughts of murder cross my mind. Also, I’m so gassy. I resigned myself to the fact that I’m definitely going to poop during labor. Good thing I brought treats for the nurses.    

Being in the hospital is both better and worse. Better because I feel like we’re making progress, but worse because I’m frequently confined to the bed during contractions while they check me in and do exams. At the first check (7 am) I’m almost 5 cm and 90% effaced. Woot! I was terrified that I’d only be 1 or 2 and they wouldn’t check me in. (RIP induction). 

I also felt comfortable asking for the epidural at this point. It seemed like things were moving kind of fast and I knew it could take a while to get. I’m glad I asked because it took **another 2.5 hours to get it.** Freaking kill me. There were some emergencies and not enough anesthesiologists. Both the nurse and my husband were prepping me to have to deliver without it. Thank god for L&D nurses because ours basically kidnapped the anesthesiologist. By the time I got the epidural I was throwing up and nearly fainting from the pain. My contractions were happening every 2 minutes and were a minute long. As soon as he positioned me for the needle, my water broke. So I’m contracting, fluid is gushing all over, and this guy is walking me through the whole thing. All I could think is “less talking, more doing.” Honestly, he could have told me he was going to puncture me with a rusty nail and I wouldn’t have cared.   

Getting that epidural was the sweetest relief (well, second sweetest. More on best relief later) I could have ever imagined. It took about 10 minutes to take the edge off and 30 for it to be completely effective. I could wiggle my toes and had movement in my right leg. My left leg was basically dead. I could feel nothing and that was the goal. I felt like I could breathe for the first time in hours. The downside is that you have to be on a clear liquid diet, but I ordered that tray and gulped down soup and juice and Italian ice.   

Also, the anesthesiologist said I could press the button for a top up every 10 minutes. You better believe I watched that clock like a hawk and pushed it on a dime.   

I wanted to nap, since I hadn’t gotten any sleep but at 10:30 the doctors and students came in to do their rounds. The more junior resident checked my cervix and got a very confused look on her face. She said “um, I don’t think I feel any cervix, just the baby’s head.” So the senior resident checked and said that I was fully dilated and ready to push. I was not mentally ready to push though. So we did some practice pushes and then the nurse took over and said I should labor down for a while. They sat me up in “throne” position, which is good for using gravity. I felt like I was sitting on a big poop. After 15 or 20 mins, the nurse asked if I’d like to push. Honestly, I didn’t. I was so scared. I was scared of tearing and bleeding and I knew this was go time. She must have seen the fear in my face because she said I could labor for a few more minutes.    

Ok, finally the pushing. I feel like since I was quite numb this part is the least exciting. I’d read a lot about different labor positions for epidurals but I just ended up laboring on my back. It was fine. I pushed when they said and I felt like I had enough energy thanks to the epidural. I also pooped.  A LOT. It smelled bad. I was kind of embarrassed. At one point I felt the table vibrate and asked what happened. My husband told me that I farted. Lol.    

After about 30 mins of pushing I started to wonder if this was ever going to happen. It seemed like the baby’s head was close but it would kind of slip back in. I asked the doctor about a different position but he said the shape of my pelvis made him think that if I was on all fours they baby would have a harder time getting past the curve. The PA student assisting suggested I ease up on the epidural so that I could feel *something* and he was probably right so I stopped hitting that button for a bit.   

Then things started to get stressful. They had a hard time keeping track of the baby’s heart rate on the monitor. This concerned me because I knew it could lead to interventions, which I didn’t want. But every time they found it, the beat was good. They just couldn’t tell if he was having decelerations. After an hour of pushing the doctor started to talk about using a vacuum. We’d seen this in our birthing class, and while we knew it was fine, I really just wanted to get the baby out.   

Since I’d backed off on the epidural top up, I could feel the contractions more. My husband encouraged me to try for three more contractions and I pushed as hard as I could. Our nurse was great and was telling me different points on my body to contract."
"Scroodiac. Hmm, I don’t know what that means but we should definitely bring it back."

Secondly, there have not been (enough) hints that Reagan used to be a male. The line “says suck my dick a lot for a woman” I don’t think qualifies as a hint. 

So that leaves an unidentified male Ridley. And as we have learned, it’s not beyond Rand to directly tinker with his daughter’s memories to make her forget a specific person. 

What I do remained puzzled by is that Reagan seems to accept that this IS her diploma, despite the seemingly incorrect pronoun on the paper.

"Trump administration Turned Down Offer To Manufacture Millions Of N95 Masks As Coronavirus Spread--After the first COVID-19 case was detected in January, a company offered to make millions of N95 masks. A federal agency said no. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/government-turned-down-offer-n95-masks-coronavirus_n_5eb6e016c5b64711c0c8cafa

But in 2018--The Trump administration failed to move forward with an Obama-era plan to make millions of protective masks for healthcare workers, according to The Washington Post. A 2015 contract with medical manufacturer O&M Halyard called for the creation of a “one-of-a-kind, high-speed machine” that could hopefully produce at least 1.5 million N95 masks per day, to resolve the kind of protective equipment shortfall plaguing clinics and hospitals today. A Halyard employee told The Post the design was delivered on time and in-budget in 2018. But the machine was never created. An HHS spokesperson told the paper that no funding was available to build it, though The Post reports that the department responsible for the project had a nearly $1.5 billion budget https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-admin-ducked-massive-mask-manufacturing-plan-wapo-reports"

"My uncle passed away in 2011 and I attended his funeral. We typically don't do open caskets in Hinduism and we cremate the body as soon as possible, but because he had helped out people in the neighborhood we held an open casket for one afternoon. 

A thousand people showed up at my late grandma's house, each one of them sobbing when they saw him and coming up to me and family members telling us about how he helped them get off the streets, how he bought clothes for them, how he gave them food when they were hungry, how he helped them get jobs, get into school.

We had no idea who my uncle was.

I carried his legs on my shoulders to the funeral van which was to take him to the cremation site, and the day after I picked up his warm bones with my bare hand and helped them release his ashes into the nearby ocean.

That was the day I realized that I was no longer a kid and that I had some big footsteps to follow if I was to make a difference to my family, my friends, myself, and everyone around me."
"Lmao that's far more realistic.

"9.54 million people in London. Put them all in a line (ignore the time it takes to do this for now). Let's constitute a meeting as you shook everyone's hand and asked them their name. I literally timed this and it took me 4.38 seconds to go ""Hi what's your name"". ""Karen"". ""Karen, nice to meet you"".

You then have to walk down the line, so that takes an extra half second or a second, so we'll make it a nice even 5 seconds to meet everyone.

Just meeting them alone is 1.51 years of non-stop 24/7 greeting each person. If you had 8 hours of sleep each night and met people for the remaining 16 hours, you could meet 11,520 people a day. So to meet the entire 9.54 million people would take you 828 days or 2.27 years.

If you instead met people in large groups at a time, you could meet 100,000 people all at once in hyde park (the largest concert ever held there). So you would have to meet 95.4 times. Assuming it takes 30 minutes to get 100,000 people in and out, so an hour for each, and you meet for 5 seconds, it would take you altogether 3.9805 days to meet everyone (including the 5 seconds of meeting). Broken up into 16 hour chunks this would be 5.96 days or almost 6 days."
"When 9/11 happened, shit got ruined for me and other brown people. When I was waiting at the bus stop, people would glare at me, someone once spat right on my shoe. I was told ""your kind is not allowed on this bus"". ""Your kind isn't allowed in this store"". The day of the incident kids threw rocks at me and said ""fucking arab piece of shit"" as I was just walking to class. I was 14. That's just the small bit of it.

I'm not arab, I'm not muslim, I'm not even from somewhere in the middle east.

This shit still goes on, to varying degrees. People stare at my mom all the time and not with curiosity, but with a ""go back home to your country"" kind of look. And I know what that look is because we've had multiple people tell us that while glaring bug-eyed with rage.

"Looks like 10 ports on each gun, and it looks like its creating at least 1 bubble per port every frame. The bubbles do tend to split a bit so it makes it slightly difficult but on the lower end of the estimate:

A frame is 0.04 seconds. 1 second = 25 frames. 10 bubbles per frame = 250 bubbles/second per gun."
"The full commercial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6fap9QeRsk

Fireman is about double the height of the battery (250 pixels tall vs 125 pixels tall), which looks like a AA. A AA battery is about 50mm, so he's about 100 mm. 

Each rung is about 22 pixels separated from each other (top of one rung to top of the next rung). The fireman looks like he's about 11 rungs in size. This is equivalent to 8.76mm (8.8mm rounded up).

It takes the little guy 8 frames to go from one rung to the next. A frame is 0.04 seconds, so 8 frames is 0.32 seconds. So 8.8mm in 0.32 seconds is 27.5 mm/s or 0.0275 m/s. 

[I counted at least 30 stories in the building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6fap9QeRsk), but it might be missing a couple of stories. I'll stick with 30 stories as a round number. It's a bit more than 3 meters per story, so about 100m in total for a 30 story building.

100m / 0.0275 m/s is

"I’d have to look at the methodology and sample size of the study before really deciding on it’s validity. However, I’m extremely curious about the following statement, “Liberals don’t understand conservative values.” Can you or someone in this thread please explain conservative values to me? 

They can’t value moral character because their president slept with a porn actress and then illegally paid them hush money with campaign funds. They can’t value justice because they think a police officer kneeling on someone’s neck until they die is a-ok as long as the victim is black and they can dig up dirt on them to justify it. Do they value helping rural America? If it was, they’d want to save the USPS since they’re the only ones who deliver out there, or at the very least they’d want their rural poor to have healthcare. What about valuing democracy? Er... no? They’re against mail in voting and in favor of voter ID, which means they want voting to be as hard as possible. They also want to keep the electoral college because it gives them an edge. How about freedom? Surely they’re in favor of that. Well... no, they cheered on unidentified federal agents black bagging protesters and are generally ok with violating civil rights so long as it doesn’t involve the 2nd amendment (and the person in question isn’t a liberal or a black person).

In so far as I can gather,  their only real value has been getting even with liberals. Why? Well, because one time one of those damn liberals called them “ignorant” or “stupid” over a comment they made which was very likely both ignorant and stupid. So great, they’re going to vote in favor of turning America into a North Korea because they are still mad several years later that people who are very likely smarter than them (“arrogant” college professors, scientists, policy wonks, journalists) talked down to them one too many times? Nice. How’s that for a conservative value? Bitter and enduring resentment along with a dash of suicidal self-hatred.

Don’t be fooled by conservatives crying about censorship. They have the biggest cable news network, the biggest radio presence, and massive social media presence.

"Guessing it’s high school/middle school? First of all I’m sorry you’ve had to deal with this. Have you gotten any administrator support? If not, you may have to call parents. You still have some leverage points. For example, grades and promotion. 

I think you have to decide if teaching at this school is still salvageable. If you want to turn it around, you need a new behavior management system. If you want to resign, you need to start getting your ducks in a row. Call out sick and get some mental health help. Most districts have an EAP (employee assistance program) that can get you free in the moment counseling that can help build you back up. 

After that gotta reflect on what direction you want to go this year. Good luck to you."

This is why I am currently buying. My landlords bought my current rental for only $85k. Threw some paint on ONE wall and rents it out for $950 a month. It’s already paid off. My mortgage for a much nicer home will be $730 a month. I’m supposed to close next week (I got my clear to close yesterday!) 

And I’m grateful I got my house and an offer on it before it even hit the market. My current sellers just bought the house 4 months ago for $90k. Put in new counters in the kitchen and a dishwasher and they’re selling it for $119k. It’s bullshit but hey, I got the house. I’m sorry you’re going through this."
You’re so welcome and good luck! Slow and steady wins the race :) when people go too hard too quickly they give up entirely but if you go slow and steady you’ll be shocked by what you can do!
My exterminator comes out a month after treatment to check again. Those bugs are damn hard to kill and get rid of! They’re damn near immortal. I’d call your exterminator. Is it possible you’re bringing them in again from somewhere? That’s an adult bed bug.
"Really? So I guess ALL TRUMP SUPPORTERS are a terrorist organization because they attacked and killed people at the Capitol? So shit, when some do it the whole party is to blame, this is your logic correct? All MAGA idiots are terrorists?"
"Mark isn’t even Democrat lmao He just hated Donald Trump like many other Republicans. I was put in Facebook jail for defending Black Lives Matter and all I said was, “You keep saying ALL lives matter but how do they when Black lives can’t even have a movement for themselves without being called terrorists?” 

I’m an Independent, left leaning, and I’m currently 2 weeks away from my recent 30 day ban. The trash ass AI is bullshit and Mark doesn’t want to PAY REGULAR ASS EMPLOYEES ANYMORE so that’s why they came out with the AI, and it sucks majorly."
"Are you able to get on food stamps? I know the eligibility requirements are ridiculous, you basically have to be make 20k a year to qualify but I would at least try. Are there any resources around you to help with rent/mortgage? I know the government issued states money to help with that. (I’m in Ohio so I can’t speak for other states that’s why I’m asking).

It’s a really awful situation to be in and I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this fear. Our government hasn’t been doing such a great job helping us when that’s their job. USA is one of the worse countries with not just handling Covid but also how they treat their citizens. 

For people saying just apply for this or that..... they’re out of touch with reality and their privilege is showing. I hope everything works out for you and peace is coming all of our way (I pray anyway). 

I know President Biden should have that extension signed soon so there might be a delay in payments (Ohio is awful with that, they’re all idiots and act like they’ve never programmed a system before). And then this may be the last extension because we may be out of the dark! (Another hopeful thought lol) 

I have a job interview today. I have a degree and a license and it hasn’t been easy finding work for me either as everyone is working remotely and they don’t want to train over the internet."
Give it more time. Eventually Facebook will either ban everyone because their AI is trash or everyone will dip out once a new platform is created. Like when everyone left MySpace for Facebook. Yeah Facebook has been around BUT everything comes to an end eventually. Like AskJeeves. com because of Google etc. Facebook will dig their own grave with this.
"Thank you! And good luck to you on all of your goals!

I’m also not sure why the font just changed on this lolol I’d contact your local Job and Family Services and ask what resources are available to assist you!"
"Lol, I give unwanted opinions too so no worries! And I’ve been told my eyeliner is heavy so it’s alright! But I still do it ;) I am not a makeup person, all I wear is eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara. Nothing on my face. Maybe one day I’ll learn how to do my makeup but I do love my eyeliner!"
YES! It’s just too bad either too many people are at fraud to stand up or people are too blind to defend themselves. We are the reason the rich people have 5 mansions while people are struggling to find even a motel room to afford for a night. That’s why I try not to contribute to many celebrities.

">Lesin’s corpse was found in a Washington, DC, hotel room on the morning of Nov. 5, 2015. The coroner determined that he had died from blunt force injuries to the head and had also sustained blunt force injuries to his neck, torso, upper extremities, and lower extremities. After an 11-month investigation, **a federal prosecutor announced in late 2016 that Lesin died alone in his room due to a series of drunken falls** “after days of excessive consumption of alcohol.” His death was ruled an “accident,”

Advertisers get away with it because many consumers are unaware that these brands are actively supporting a scumbag propagandist like Hannity. Just need to make consumers aware of how insanely nasty he is and what brands are proping him up.
"This is why republicans don't suffer from the same levels of apathy, voters being scared of boogeymen makes it really easy to have them always vote and then you don't really have to do anything except claim to have protected them from the enemy/boogeyman that was going to take your guns and force you to abort your baby under fema camp sharia law and then force you to gay marry a horse, because you know it is a slippery slope, ldo. 

Democrats have it much harder and try to promise voters tangible things like increased healthcare and safety nets and public investments that their voters need, but these are hard things that require congress and republicans can obstruct in most cases, and even if they make improvements it can never be good enough, so then the democratic base is apathetic at the lack of utopia under D president and falls back into ""both sides suck"" e.g., we are staying home and letting the republicans win again. And then republicans win and D base is reminded ""oh shit these people are dangerous nuts"" better vote and unite, then dems win then utopia doesn't happen then dem voters stay home, ect, ect, the idiot cycle continues. See Gore vs GW Bush in 2000 when ""both sides were the same"". And Hillary vs Trump in 2016 when ""both are terrible!"", was the apathy mantra. "
"Ding ding ding. Remember that the GWB administration - the one that lied to get us into a trillion dollar war.

"This is an email Cohn sent to friends that Wolff got a copy of for his book:

>It’s worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump won’t read anything – not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers; nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored. And his staff is no better. Kushner is an entitled baby who knows nothing. Bannon is an arrogant prick who thinks he’s smarter than he is. Trump is less a person than a collection of terrible traits. No one will survive the first year but his family. I hate the work, but feel I need to stay because I’m the only person there with a clue what he’s doing. The reason so few jobs have been filled is that they only accept people who pass ridiculous purity tests, even for midlevel policy-making jobs where the people will never see the light of day.”"

"You need to change the electorate first, the US electorate is simply not that liberal, it is full of resentful old white people, rednecks and legions of single issue evangelical rightwing voters. The left is in denial for why progress is so slow, it is because their policy goals don't have the support they wish they did when you actually include the part where taxes on everyone must go up and you also have to agree to give the government more control over ""x"" and you have to agree to give poor people and minorities the benefits too.

"It is not surprising that we would trend this way considering our presidential elections are covered like a superficial personality centric reality TV contest. There is very little detailed policy analysis during the general election and even less analysis around what they could actually accomplish with the congress they will likely have during their term. Trump figured this out, so he basically didn't even bother to put out a coherent policy platform, just shallow nice sounding rhetoric, platitudes and lies. He understood that the for-profit media and the idiot electorate aren't capable of understanding policy anyway, so why bother? This is essentially how Gore lost as well, George W. Bush was the more likeable reality TV character. Gore was of course 1000x more qualified and ran on a far better more detailed platform, but the media and public don't focus on that, instead they focused on Gore's wooden speaking pattern during debates, or how he was rude to Bush during a debate when he tried to explain Bush's tax cuts were based on lies and would squander our surpluses (They were and they did). Or how Gore was swiftboated because he used awkward wording to explain his very significant contributions to jump starting the internet with proper federal support.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore_and_information_technology#Congressional_work_and_Gore_Bill"

""But they are both terrible"" was a favorite upvoted comment during the general election on r/politics as though they had all been triggered to irrationally hate Hillary to the point they couldn't see this election was about stopping republicans from sweeping total control of the federal government and stealing a supreme court seat.

And that's why Trump had time, in the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, to rant against Mexico & make more threats about forcing Mexico to build the border wall, even while that country was offering to help the U.S. after the disaster.

And, Trump was so busy dealing with his own *'awful natural disasters'*, that he didn't have time to even notice the earthquake & hurricane that hit our neighbor?  He must be easily overwhelmed. 

There is nothing *'perfectly understandable'*, as you say, about any of this.

"Horse racing.  Here’s from the link:

The phrase ""hands down"" has come to denote an easy victory, or one by a large margin. It's one of those phrases that's so ubiquitous now that it's tough to tell where it came from — some mistakenly think it's rooted in poker or boxing, two other games that involve ""hands"" of some form or another. 

In reality, this phrase comes to us from horse racing jockeys of the 19th century. When one horse was leading the pack comfortably, its jockey was able to relax a little bit and loosen their grip on the horse's reins by putting their ""hands down,"" allowing the horse to finish out the race without physical encouragement. Since then, the term's use has evolved to describe anything said to be the best by a substantial margin, as in: ""Hands down, it was the movie of the year."""

This goes far beyond training. It is a basic character flaw to think bullying a mentally ill person is ok. Empathy and understanding are no where to be found in what happened. It is a wonder he did not get sued.
It is common for restaurants to be robbed through the back door after hours. Was in the news a lot a while back. Murdered crew at some. For a while people were stealing their grease drums too.....
Showing your true character there. Well done!
Do you live in the US? If so you are untitled to your moms Social Security death benefits. You are entitled to SS disability benefits for your dad and death benefits after he passes. All that will help ends meet. Get help. Let the school councilor know what you are going through. Ask a church for help. You can get food and clothes from them. Connect with Health and Human services. They have plenty of agencies that can help. Get an Advocate there assigned to you. Who is watching the kids while you work?
I get it really. That is what an advocate is for. They look the stuff up for you. You aren’t going to get rejected. Your situation is why those agencies exist. You can fill out the applications online and mail them in. If your finances are easier you could hire someone to watch the kids while you go back to school.
Let him know how you feel and that you are completely ashamed of his behavior. I had to go through that with my dad when I was in high school. I am a wildlife conservation advocate and I found photos of him with endangered animal kills. Lost all respect at that point. I was not able to get through to him and my parents divorced not to long after. I hope you have better luck.
Wow! Never seen one flower!
You are assuming everyone has a good memory when that is not the case at all. People forget things over time. I read about a study that said if you don’t pull memories up from time to time your brain sweeps them away. I am blessed with a very good memory that was photographic when I was younger. I could read a page in a textbook and close my eyes and see it when taking a test. My memory can recall events with great detail. I can describe things that happened when I was younger that my family members cannot recall. They have few memories from that far back. What they do remember is selective and major events but not always. As I get older I have noticed my recall is not as good as it used to be. Think about it like all those facts you learned in school? Do you still recall them? Probably not unless you applied them in your job.
Would you look into it if you knew it was over $2000 a month? There is a chance it could be. Caretakers can also get a check from Heath and Human services.There is also a monthly Covid check for families. And if mom or dad were veterans there are college checks up to age 25 I believe if the veteran is dead. A lot of this can be paid to your siblings too.

They are sooo big! Look like out of a cartoon and they fly in formation like they are drunk!
My mom and step dad are 91. They had to heat their dinner and hot tea in the fireplace over the gas burner in Waco. Over 117 people died in Texas of hypothermia. Let me add also that my stepdad is diabetic. He missed 3 appointments for dialysis because the electricity was out at the clinic. He ended up in the hospital getting emergency dialysis a week later. They did not release him until he was stable. I live 4 hours away. If I could have driven up there I would have. The roads were not passable. This is not the first time they went for a week in winter with no electricity. They slept in the den with the fireplace on just to stay warm. I tried to get a medical waver so their house was not part of the rolling blackouts but their Dr. refused to sign it. Said heat was not a medical necessity for them. WTH????
Husband with stage 3 brain cancer fully infiltrated. I am the stability in the relationship. Just don’t join in the arena when he wanders off reality. I learned the phrase “Well that isn’t going to happen”. I set boundaries and try to maintain them. Keep the same routine everyday. He has no short term memory so I repeat things a lot or write them down for him. It is draining. When it gets to be too much I have him visit his mom so I can get a bit of down time.
"So this is mixing colors to form light? I would assume since in light the addition of all color is white, the absence of all color light is black. In paint however the addition of all color is black. The absence is white. (Or a blank white canvas)"
Conjecture at this point. The article I read said he may not have wanted them prosecuted for murder. They still hung murderers back then. They were young kids there on vacation with their parents.
Then get pro Bono legal help. There are lawyers who take these cases as a public service. Get them legally your dependents. If SS turns you down get a letter from your congressman and they will snap to immediately. You can apply online for the letter.
I and my family are very disappointed. Is it your wish for a whole generation to be in debt to college their whole lives????
Is this true? What about all the test pilots who died in planes over the years prior to that?
Let me make this perfectly clear though. If your father dies before you get guardianship the state will take your siblings into foster care. It is the fall back for all situations where the parents pass away unless they have legally made arrangements for guardianship on the event of their death. If it is at all possible get your father to sign those papers. Even then they may be sent to foster care until it is sorted legally. Your sister has every right to be upset as sexual child abuse is rampant in the foster care system. It is imperative that this be sorted now. Once they are in foster care the state may decide to separate them out and adopt them all out and you may never see them again. Of course you did not sign up to be a parent to your family. But that is the cards you were dealt. Put college on hold until you can get this sorted. I know you cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel now but it is there and things will settle down. I would say it would take about a year. Then you can get back on track with your life while having help with your family. Please don’t make a rash decision that will affect the rest of your life as well as your brothers and sisters. College is a short 4 years. Your family lasts a lifetime. You are all they have right now. With Covid restrictions most of that will be handled online right now.
They still act like a cheer leader.....that attitude.

> The emails, which Miller sent to the conservative website Breitbart News in 2015 and 2016, showcase the extremist, anti-immigrant ideology that undergirds the policies he has helped create as an architect of Donald Trump’s presidency. These policies include reportedly setting arrest quotas for undocumented immigrants, an executive order effectively banning immigration from five Muslim-majority countries and a policy of family separation at refugee resettlement facilities that the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General said is causing “intense trauma” in children.

According to the article, Miller used his government email address when he was an aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions to send the majority of those emails.

Shortly before he was due to pay Deutsche Bank $40 million for a portion of the loan he had personally guaranteed, Trump filed a lawsuit against the German bank, demanding $3 billion to compensate him for the international economic turmoil that Trump claimed the bank had helped cause and that Trump now said was hurting his investment in Chicago.

"Surveillance footage from the March 15 altercation at Star Spirits & Beverages in Decatur began circulating on social media over the weekend amid protests over police brutality and racism following the death of George Floyd. The store's owner, 47-year-old Kevin Penn, had told 911 dispatchers that he was holding a shoplifter at gunpoint. At a press conference on Monday, Decatur Police Chief Nate Allen acknowledged that the responding officer, who has not been named, punched Penn because he thought he was the shoplifter. Penn suffered a broken jaw, had his teeth knocked out and needed to get his mouth wired shut as a result, according to his lawyer Carl Cole.

Another was New Yorker magazine reporter Luke Mogelson, who said an officer took a photo of his press pass and promised to alert other police not to touch his car. Mogelson returned to four flat tires and officers who ""were laughing. ... They had grins on their faces.""

"Everything clearly points to the step father of having something to do with this disappearance of Katelin. It seems incredible that after four long years the police can't seem to solve this and it seems to have turned into yet another cold case. The police have also stated they have not had any contact with the step dad in over two years which seems even more surprising. I think the cherry on the cake of this whole investigation is this statement from the police 'it is possible that Katelin hasn’t met with foul play, and had ran away'. No wonder so many cases are never solved.   "

Stephanie Rapkin 64, a probate lawyer from the suburban Milwaukee town of Shorewood, Wisconsin, was arrested on Saturday for spitting on Eric Patrick Lucas, 17. Rapkin parked her car in the middle of the street blocking a protest by hundreds of locals in Shorewood on Saturday afternoon. According to authorities, a Black Lives Matter march was heading south on North Oakland Avenue when Rapkin left her car in the middle of the intersection of East Jarvis Street and North Oakland Avenue so as to obstruct the procession. Rapkin is then seen walking on the sidewalk and confronting a large group of protesters, most of whom appeared to be in their teens and 20s. Rapkin then spits on the boy. Other protesters crowd around her, urging her to return to her vehicle."

"Trump administration Turned Down Offer To Manufacture Millions Of N95 Masks As Coronavirus Spread--After the first COVID-19 case was detected in January, a company offered to make millions of N95 masks. A federal agency said no. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/government-turned-down-offer-n95-masks-coronavirus_n_5eb6e016c5b64711c0c8cafa

But in 2018--The Trump administration failed to move forward with an Obama-era plan to make millions of protective masks for healthcare workers, according to The Washington Post. A 2015 contract with medical manufacturer O&M Halyard called for the creation of a “one-of-a-kind, high-speed machine” that could hopefully produce at least 1.5 million N95 masks per day, to resolve the kind of protective equipment shortfall plaguing clinics and hospitals today. A Halyard employee told The Post the design was delivered on time and in-budget in 2018. But the machine was never created. An HHS spokesperson told the paper that no funding was available to build it, though The Post reports that the department responsible for the project had a nearly $1.5 billion budget https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-admin-ducked-massive-mask-manufacturing-plan-wapo-reports"

"That phrase is used for compassion's sake. No one wants to hear or think about someone suffering, especially a loved one, when they die. There are some mechanisms of injury, such as severe head trauma which exposes brain tissue, which would lead to a very rapid death, but short of the brain literally exploding, there isn't ""instant"" death. In the decades I worked as an emergency room RN, I know that is just something we tell families to comfort them."
"Former ED RN here.  When listening to a patient's lungs I used to place my stethoscope on their chest and instruct them by saying, ""big breath"" each time I needed them to breathe deeply.  That was, until I saw a shocked look on a family member's face seeing my (male) hand apparently on the patient's chest and commenting about her ""big breasts.""  I immediately changed to saying, ""deep breath."""

Never make an agreement for a future exchange of goods or services against prepayment, including deposits, without a contract.

Alcohol used to be the antiseptic of choice for instruments and surfaces in healthcare settings. It remains so in some countries and settings. Alcohol was only replaced because it was ineffective against spores and some viruses.

">Lesin’s corpse was found in a Washington, DC, hotel room on the morning of Nov. 5, 2015. The coroner determined that he had died from blunt force injuries to the head and had also sustained blunt force injuries to his neck, torso, upper extremities, and lower extremities. After an 11-month investigation, **a federal prosecutor announced in late 2016 that Lesin died alone in his room due to a series of drunken falls** “after days of excessive consumption of alcohol.” His death was ruled an “accident,”

This prosecutor needs to be investigated."

Advertisers get away with it because many consumers are unaware that these brands are actively supporting a scumbag propagandist like Hannity. Just need to make consumers aware of how insanely nasty he is and what brands are proping him up.
"This is why republicans don't suffer from the same levels of apathy, voters being scared of boogeymen makes it really easy to have them always vote and then you don't really have to do anything except claim to have protected them from the enemy/boogeyman that was going to take your guns and force you to abort your baby under fema camp sharia law and then force you to gay marry a horse, because you know it is a slippery slope, ldo. 

Democrats have it much harder and try to promise voters tangible things like increased healthcare and safety nets and public investments that their voters need, but these are hard things that require congress and republicans can obstruct in most cases, and even if they make improvements it can never be good enough, so then the democratic base is apathetic at the lack of utopia under D president and falls back into ""both sides suck"" e.g., we are staying home and letting the republicans win again. And then republicans win and D base is reminded ""oh shit these people are dangerous nuts"" better vote and unite, then dems win then utopia doesn't happen then dem voters stay home, ect, ect, the idiot cycle continues. See Gore vs GW Bush in 2000 when ""both sides were the same"". And Hillary vs Trump in 2016 when ""both are terrible!"", was the apathy mantra. "
"Ding ding ding. Remember that the GWB administration - the one that lied to get us into a trillion dollar war.

"This is an email Cohn sent to friends that Wolff got a copy of for his book:

>It’s worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump won’t read anything – not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers; nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored. And his staff is no better. Kushner is an entitled baby who knows nothing. Bannon is an arrogant prick who thinks he’s smarter than he is. Trump is less a person than a collection of terrible traits. No one will survive the first year but his family. I hate the work, but feel I need to stay because I’m the only person there with a clue what he’s doing. The reason so few jobs have been filled is that they only accept people who pass ridiculous purity tests, even for midlevel policy-making jobs where the people will never see the light of day.”"

"You need to change the electorate first, the US electorate is simply not that liberal, it is full of resentful old white people, rednecks and legions of single issue evangelical rightwing voters. The left is in denial for why progress is so slow, it is because their policy goals don't have the support they wish they did when you actually include the part where taxes on everyone must go up and you also have to agree to give the government more control over ""x"" and you have to agree to give poor people and minorities the benefits too.

"It is not surprising that we would trend this way considering our presidential elections are covered like a superficial personality centric reality TV contest. There is very little detailed policy analysis during the general election and even less analysis around what they could actually accomplish with the congress they will likely have during their term. Trump figured this out, so he basically didn't even bother to put out a coherent policy platform, just shallow nice sounding rhetoric, platitudes and lies. He understood that the for-profit media and the idiot electorate aren't capable of understanding policy anyway, so why bother? This is essentially how Gore lost as well, George W. Bush was the more likeable reality TV character. Gore was of course 1000x more qualified and ran on a far better more detailed platform, but the media and public don't focus on that, instead they focused on Gore's wooden speaking pattern during debates, or how he was rude to Bush during a debate when he tried to explain Bush's tax cuts were based on lies and would squander our surpluses (They were and they did). Or how Gore was swiftboated because he used awkward wording to explain his very significant contributions to jump starting the internet with proper federal support.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore_and_information_technology#Congressional_work_and_Gore_Bill"
The 2016 general election was basically a giant Rorschach test on how the general electorate prefers the alpha-male leader archetype over a female one even when the male is so unfit and unqualified and buffoonish that it makes satire difficult.

"I mean it worked, my know nothing evangelical relatives happily marched to polls in 2016 for Trump (after being never Trump during primary) because of the supreme court. Meanwhile progressives under 30 were awash in apathy and conspiracy theories that their nonsensical hype fairytale purity candidate didn't win the primary and were almost completely ignoring the generation shifting political consequences of open supreme court seat and republicans controlling all of congress in 2016. ""But they are both terrible"" was a favorite upvoted comment during the general election on r/politics as though they had all been triggered to irrationally hate Hillary to the point they couldn't see this election was about stopping republicans from sweeping total control of the federal government and stealing a supreme court seat.
