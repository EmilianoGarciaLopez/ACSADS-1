humanity and all life as a whole the magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did when jesus died for our sins he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality after you die your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society no wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son for youd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos through which unrecognizable core you can only find misfortune i would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality you have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering worse than any human concept of hell you are such an unholy being that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair you are an idiotic shiteating dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you rhodes island would have been better off if youd never joined us you are a lying backstabbing cowardly useless piece of shit and i hate you with every single part of my being even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up and how incredibly idiotic you are anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time for if divine beings were real they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe in the future there will be horror stories made about you with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now you are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination but here you are its hard to believe that i am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes but here i am so unfortunately i cannot deny your existence even if i did my very best my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you even if time travel some day will be invented there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it i cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you not a single word of the incoherent illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did the countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had making concepts such as laws irrelevant right from the moment i first set my eyes on you i knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity i was hoping i would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring you are the worst human being or even just being in general that i have ever had the misfortune of witnessing events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created but not even mankinds greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created if you ever had them your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are except you will never be able to have children because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched you are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents but to your ancestors and entire bloodline the disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again the sheer scale of your mistake if ever to be materialized would not only surpass the size of the world but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known and almost certainly the unknown universe i could sit here and write paragraphs nay books describing your immense failure yet even if i were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here and i would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that i would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world you are an irresponsible idiotic disgusting unloved horrible excuse for a living being whos soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined the absolute disgust i feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when i am honest about it i think that even i do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it when people of columbia fought to break free from lungmen countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now honestly even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate i do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe my hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of shambala that you could probably take the entire lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate and honestly i do not want to exaggerate but i think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest my hate is almost certainly bottomless there is no one in this world that has ever loved you and especially after what you just did no one will ever love you in the future either there is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better and in fact quite the opposite might be true by making the mistake that you just did you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are the only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in,1627,1

plan and even if youre like me and think you dont have a plan it will probably not happen but now im in recovery and just smitten with this adorable little baby all i really wanted was a 39w induction and an epidural i didnt plan much for birth beyond that in the hospital where i delivered its standard for them to do delayed cord clamping and immediate skin to skin so i didnt feel like i had to add those to a plan in the end i only got one of those things and that just barely 383 and i notice a significant drop in the babys movement so we go to ld to get checked on the nst they notice im having contractions every 810 mins but i cant feel a thing they checked to see if i was dilated at all but nada i was really hoping for something because it would be great if i made progress without feeling a thing but it was not to be on 39w exactly is when i was scheduled for the induction i waited all day for a call about what time to come in but didnt hear anything i called around 3 and they told me 7730 but theyd call back to confirm never heard back so i called around 630 and they said they were super busy but theyd call back in a few hours dont hear anything until 930 and they say maybe midnight right around midnight i start noticing contractions and i think hm i guess this kid knows hes scheduled to come out and hes trying to get the jump on me i talked to the charge nurse at 1230a and she said that it could be a few more hours i had the option of a call as soon as a bed opened or waiting for the morning shift we decided to get a call as soon as there was an opening because who knows what will happen if we miss that chance i decide to try to get some sleep because i dont believe that theyre going to call in a few hours i think itll be 4 or 5 at the earliest my husband wants to stay up whatever thats his choice though i think its a bad one im also noticing that these contractions are not slowing down so i start timing them theyre at least a minute long but happening between 915 minutes cool nothing to worry about i get in bed around 130 and try to sleep but damn these contractions are hitting pretty close together i try to time them but im half falling asleep when they start and cant really work my phone husband comes to bed around 230 and immediately falls asleep i hate him and think about waking him up because im jealous he starts snoring i think about killing him at 330 i decide laboring next to a buzz saw in the dark sucks and i get up and get dressed i also get a snack my whole birth plan had been induction and epidural i havent taken one nonmedicated birthing class so laboring in my kitchen kind of sucks i do yoga breathing i drop a lot of fbombs are these low intensity contractions walking around feels alright every contraction makes me ponder the word bearable i suppose anything can be bearable if you dont die in the middle of it by 4 the contractions are 6 minutes apart im glad i got some books on audible earlier in the week because i dont feel like watching tv or listening to music side note highly recommend bad blood the book about theranos you may be in labor but at least youre not a psycho who defrauded people out of billions perspective i keep expecting the contractions to stop they dont they get closer together by the time they reach 5 mins apart i wake my husband which is like waking a bear in hibernation luckily women in labor are scary and he jumps right up we drive to the hospital and i wonder if hes trying to hit every pothole on the way there more thoughts of murder cross my mind also im so gassy i resigned myself to the fact that im definitely going to poop during labor good thing i brought treats for the nurses being in the hospital is both better and worse better because i feel like were making progress but worse because im frequently confined to the bed during contractions while they check me in and do exams at the first check 7 am im almost 5 cm and 90 effaced woot i was terrified that id only be 1 or 2 and they wouldnt check me in rip induction i also felt comfortable asking for the epidural at this point it seemed like things were moving kind of fast and i knew it could take a while to get im glad i asked because it took another 25 hours to get it freaking kill me there were some emergencies and not enough anesthesiologists both the nurse and my husband were prepping me to have to deliver without it thank god for ld nurses because ours basically kidnapped the anesthesiologist by the time i got the epidural i was throwing up and nearly fainting from the pain my contractions were happening every 2 minutes and were a minute long as soon as he positioned me for the needle my water broke so im contracting fluid is gushing all over and this guy is walking me through the whole thing all i could think is less talking more doing honestly he could have told me he was going to puncture me with a rusty nail and i wouldnt have cared getting that epidural was the sweetest relief well second sweetest more on best relief later i could have ever imagined it took about 10 minutes to take the edge off and 30 for it to be completely effective i could wiggle my toes and had movement in my right leg my left leg was basically dead i could feel nothing and that was the goal i felt like i could breathe for the first time in hours the downside is that you have to be on a clear liquid diet but i ordered that tray and gulped down soup and juice and italian ice also the anesthesiologist said i could press the button for a top up every 10 minutes you better believe i watched that clock like a hawk and pushed it on a dime i wanted to nap since i hadnt gotten any sleep but at 1030 the doctors and students came in to do their rounds the more junior resident checked my cervix and got a very confused look on her face she said um i dont think i feel any cervix just the babys head so the senior resident checked and said that i was fully dilated and ready to push i was not mentally ready to push though so we did some practice pushes and then the nurse took over and said i should labor down for a while they sat me up in throne position which is good for using gravity i felt like i was sitting on a big poop after 15 or 20 mins the nurse asked if id like to push honestly i didnt i was so scared i was scared of tearing and bleeding and i knew this was go time she must have seen the fear in my face because she said i could labor for a few more minutes ok finally the pushing i feel like since i was quite numb this part is the least exciting id read a lot about different labor positions for epidurals but i just ended up laboring on my back it was fine i pushed when they said and i felt like i had enough energy thanks to the epidural i also pooped a lot it smelled bad i was kind of embarrassed at one point i felt the table vibrate and asked what happened my husband told me that i farted lol after about 30 mins of pushing i started to wonder if this was ever going to happen it seemed like the babys head was close but it would kind of slip back in i asked the doctor about a different position but he said the shape of my pelvis made him think that if i was on all fours they baby would have a harder time getting past the curve the pa student assisting suggested i ease up on the epidural so that i could feel something and he was probably right so i stopped hitting that button for a bit then things started to get stressful they had a hard time keeping track of the babys heart rate on the monitor this concerned me because i knew it could lead to interventions which i didnt want but every time they found it the beat was good they just couldnt tell if he was having decelerations after an hour of pushing the doctor started to talk about using a vacuum wed seen this in our birthing class and while we knew it was fine i really just wanted to get the baby out since id backed off on the epidural top up i could feel the contractions more my husband encouraged me to try for three more contractions and i pushed as hard as i could our nurse was great and was telling me different points on my body to contract,1644,-1

a group of banks including deutsche bank to build his chicago tower but by 2008 the real estate market had gone bad and trump was in financial trouble shortly before he was due to pay deutsche bank 40 million for a portion of the loan he had personally guaranteed trump filed a lawsuit against the german bank demanding 3 billion to compensate him for the international economic turmoil that trump claimed the bank had helped cause and that trump now said was hurting his investment in chicago and the head of the deutsche bank division that loaned trump 364 million just got a big promotion deutsche bank the struggling financial giant that is donald trumps biggest lender anointed a new ceo a longtime executive named christian sewing hes worked in a number of roles at the bank but whats significant about his résumé is the job he held prior to his promotion he oversaw the firms private bank the division that caters to highnetworth clients and has loaned trumps company hundreds of millions of dollars over the years when few lenders including deutsche banks own commercial lending arm would do business with the bankruptcyprone businessman according to trumps financial disclosures he has loans with the bank totaling as much as 364 million and possibly how deutsche bank enabled a dirty offshore bank to move dark money deutsche bank facilitated hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions for a corrupt cyprus bank that served as a hub for illicit money from the darkest corners of the criminal underworld a trove of secret documents obtained by buzzfeed news reveals deutsche and its new york subsidiary under scrutiny for its loans to donald trump provided a crucial bridge between fbme bank and the global financial system acting as its longstanding correspondent bank in

by suing to enforce their confidentiality agreement william burck and kavanaugh mr burck supervised a team of lawyers that examined thousands of documents a process that has been bitterly criticized by democrats who say mr burck is an administration ally and longtime kavanaugh friend who cannot be trusted democrats hope to use the fact that mr burck oversaw a process that led to the withholding of more than 100000 pages of documents to argue that they know too little about judge kavanaughs record to move ahead with his confirmation hearings on tuesday russia probes most popular lawyer risks conflicts steve bannon is represented by william burck a veteran attorney and former federal prosecutor who helped send martha stewart to jail and who also counsels two other trump insiders of

embroiled in russian money laundering scandals and whose loans to trump are coming under intensifying scrutiny court documents and company records show that afi was cited in the prevezon case as a

million for a portion of the loan he had personally guaranteed trump filed a lawsuit against the german bank demanding 3 billion to compensate him for the international economic turmoil that trump claimed the bank had helped cause and that trump now said was hurting his investment in chicago and the head of the deutsche bank division that loaned trump 364 million just got a big promotion

by suing to enforce their confidentiality agreement william burck and kavanaugh mr burck supervised a team of lawyers that examined thousands of documents a process that has been bitterly criticized by democrats who say mr burck is an administration ally and longtime kavanaugh friend who cannot be trusted democrats hope to use the fact that mr burck oversaw a process that led to the withholding

request told the guardian that federal investigators and the us treasury approached the central bank of cyprus in november seeking detailed information about fbme which was shut down this year one

3808,1,0.2707608820117885,0.729239117988207,1,1910,there is a whole field of study theodicy devoted to answering these questions so if you want answers there is plenty to find that being said if you just want my personal take on it it comes down to a question of optimization to question gods morality vis a vis the existence of evil is to fundamentally accuse god of poor design essentially you are saying that the system is suboptimal by necessity you need to define the optima to be able to determine if a system is in fact suboptimal it would seem that you are trying to establish an optima based off of some kind of moral good how can this be measured lets say by whether or not it minimizes suffering if this were the case then as you pointed out the system is suboptimal in fact if god had made us all plants we would never know suffering so would the world be a better place if we were all just mindless plants it doesnt seem so why not well there is a lot of good in this world that comes from the fact that we have minds and can form relationships so perhaps the existence of love could be an optima as it happens when optimizing a system you can and often do have to consider multiple optima an airplane is clearly inferior to a tank if the only consideration is durability but if we also want to optimize for being light enough to fly fuel efficiency as a function of weight aerodynamics etc carrying capacity etc a boeing 747 is better optimized than an abrams is it better than a b52 though well that is an issue of which of the competing optima are prioritized over others for military applications durability and being able to withstand small arms fire are going to be a bigger priority than in commercial applications likewise cargo capacity is a higher priority relative to passenger capacity if you want to drop a bunch of bombs which optima are higher or lower in priority are dependent on the intended function or purpose so we have to determine the multiple competing optima for the world we live in and their priority relative to the purpose for the existence of the world we have to know why we are here do you know that because that is one of the greatest mysteries of the ages so if you have that figured out you should probably share with the rest of the class i dont claim to have it all figured out but i know it isnt simply to exist in the absence of suffering if god wanted that he would have just made a garden he didnt just make a garden he also made adam and eve what is the purpose of humanity well in the same way that we could say that we wouldnt be better off as plants because we would never experience love could we not consider love as an optima for the creation of the world what would that look like how do you optimize for love what does it require in the same way that an airplane cant achieve flight without sufficient lift generated by the wings to offset the weight love requires free will noone ever loved anybody involuntarily so how do we optimize for free will an old quote from henry ford when they first started mass production of the model t was something to the effect of you can have any color you want so long as its black the joke being that if you restrict all the choices down to one then it is no longer a choice we cant love unless we are given the option not to love likewise we cant actually do good or at least it is no credit to us unless we have the option to do evil free will is baked into the cake so to speak without it we could never love eachother or god what does having actual free will look like how much freedom does it take to really be free often we look at cultures with arranged marriages and criticize them for not having true love if you are technically free to marry whoever you want but there is just this one person that your parents arranged for you to marry and society expects you to marry that person and almost everybody else that you could possibly marry is already betrothed to their arranged marriage so you choose to go along with your arranged marriage was that really your own choice likewise consider if god was visibly physically omnipresent he automatically smites anyone who does any evil and you have the choice of whether to love him and follow him orit really isnt much of a choice logically noone would ever be able to choose not to follow you know how people feel awkward at work when their boss is there working with them and they feel like they are constantly being scrutinized and it is really stressful imagine that turned up to eleven is that the kind of world that would be properly optimized for gods purposes not likely so we have to be totally free to commit unspeakable evils and choose to do good instead we have to be completely free to ignore god and choose to love him instead that does open the door for a multitude of suffering but that is what is necessary and as it happens knowing god is far and away greater in magnitude than any amount of suffering and lasts for an eternity while all suffering is but a breath now you might criticize me or god himself for taking lightly the suffering we endure for the sake of the opportunity to be in relationship with him is he ignorant of our suffering does he know how we feel does he even care well he gave up his only son to be brutally murdered and in the person of jesus experienced that brutality firsthand and he endured it all just to make a way for us to be redeemed and be able to be in relationship with him i would say he gets it,1039,1
