"This is one of the most unreasonable threads I've ever seen. Not you OP - the comments. Even if you factor out the parents you paid off a shit load of debt on a yearly pretty low income. You did literally every step personal finance recommends and they are attacking you for it. You got outside help when you could, you stayed at home actually a lot less than you should have (3 months after college is somehow unreasonable now?). You negotiated pay raises and changed jobs as needed. You made a proper budget. You cut every corner you reasonably could.

The problem these people have? You didn't make excuses and used every advantage you possibly could. Your advantages were less than your average redditor. Think about it: The average US redditor is a college aged white kid from New York or California according to reddits own data. These are opulent areas and its very safe to assume they have parental help - likely much more so than yours as they are in insanely over priced areas.

"I wrote this bot and it lasted a whole 2 days before getting banned without a reason. After I reached out to the mods they informed me that ""We ban most reply bots like this."" Honestly really disappointing considering almost everyone got a kick out of it.  Anyway, these kinds of decisions should be voted on by the community and not just blatantly decided to. Below I’ve made a poll to see if people would like to keep the bot on the subreddit:

"Bxf14 is by far the best move for LibRight. It forces LibLeft to take with their king and give up castling rights. They will be left with a permanently crippled position and have a hard time activating their rook.

You might be thinking, can’t LibLeft just take with the rook? Here’s why that wouldn’t be all that good:

Taking with the rook is actually worse because it that creates a weak d13 AND e13 pawn which can now be targets for AuthLeft and LibRight. 

AuthLeft can play c10 which immediately attacks the e pawn and pins it to the rook forcing LibLeft to play Re14 to guard the pawn. This is just suboptimal as it loses a tempo and helps AuthLeft develop their pieces.


Source: I have no life and play 10s of hours of chess every week."
"The pawn moves are actually not all that bad. In four person chess you’re better off playing in a more defensive hypermodern style and using the scope of the bishops to control the board. 

LibLeft and Authleft are playing what in normal chess would be called the Van’t Krujis Opening (assuming they are playing as white. As black this would be the English defense). It was named after a Dutch player Maarten van't Kruijs who was the  Dutch chess champion back in 1878. 

This opening is extremely rare in high level chess and not all that great for white normally. However, in this variant of chess it’s a useful move to play in the more hypermodern style of chess by fianchettoing the bishops and playing slow pawn moves to eventually lash out in the center once your pieces are developed. Pushing the king pawn two squares also immediately creates a piece that can become a target for the other players since it’s no longer protected.

Anyway the idea would be to play something like m10 and fianchetto the bishop. And then you can develop your knights and castle long or short. Pretty decent way to play probably not the best but it’s definitely not wrong or anything.


**TL;DR:** bishops go brrr

"So I've made it my mission in life to rob every single one of mr. keks stores I come across ever since he fucked me up as a 9 years old playing this game. It's a pretty good money making scheme too if you pull it off right but for me it's personal. 

Things you need:

X-Ray specs - useful for finding where the shops are

Mobile Scarf - I use this to hide in the walls so mr. kek can't touch me

Pikachu - I personally like Pikachu because for dungeon exploration solo this thing is great, agility makes it easier to run from mr. kek since he's permenantly at x2 speed. Also it gets the stair sensor IQ skill which makes it a bit easier to locate the stairs room so you can get out of there asap. 

Crap ton of Gold Ribbons/Lost Loot

Anyway onto the steps:

1. Go to marine resort after equipping x-ray specs
2. Keep climbing levels till you find a kek shop. 
3. Once you find a kek store also locate where the stairs are
4. Now clear the kek shop of any items, and place down your gold ribbons/lost loot. 
5. Sell them to mr. kek, and then pick them back up. 
6. Equip your mobile scarf 
7. Agility 4 times till you're at quadruple speed. 
8. Yeet into the walls and make a beeline for the stairs room. Agility as needed if you're out of the walls and a kek comes near. Because of how movement works in this game as long as you stay a level above the kek they won't even ever get to move.
9. Profit???

Yes you can use a pure seed as well but there's no reliable way to farm them so I prefer this method. 

Twarl orbs are a bit more risky since mr. kek will fuck you up if one spawns in the room while you're picking up the items."

"This whole comment reeks of victim blaming. The equivalent would be telling this to a woman who’s talking about her rape story: 

“I don’t mean to insult you at all but what’s the common denominator? I and all my male friends know tons of women none of whom have been sexually assaulted or raped. How is it that you’ve experienced this specific circumstance twice while no one I know has experienced it once?

Do you frequently wear short skirts out in public? Are you the type who goes out partying and drinking? Do you often sleep with men who are likely to commit domestic violence and/or rape?

I’m really not sure what questions to ask but the fact that this has happened to you twice makes me think that your behavior is at least part of the problem.”

Why is your immediate response to blame the dude and imply that it’s his fault in some way instead of empathizing with him and blaming the person who committed the immoral and illegal action?"

https://www.reddit.com/user/Blank-Cheque/comments/mbmthf/why_is_this_subreddit_private_see_here_for_answers/

However, given the extremely delayed response and honestly relatively poor handling of this situation we aren't entirely impressed. We're not about waiting for others to fix the problem for us though - so we have decided to do something about it.

We've started a fundraiser for a great charity dedicated to preventing child abuse - the PCAA (Prevent Child Abuse America). While the subreddit was private we managed to raise over ~~$5,000~~ **$10,000** for this charity. But we can do more!

Join your fellow /r/Conservative posters and friends (Even lefties, this had bipartisan support) in donating a couple bucks to help out a great cause. This was organized on our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/conservative) in only a few short hours and we are already over $5,000 in donations from just the discord alone. 

https://secure.givelively.org/donate/prevent-child-abuse-america/prevent-child-abuse-america/r-conservative

Thank you to everyone who has donated so far. To anyone who can't afford to donate, please spread the word about this charity. [You can read more about the charity here.](https://preventchildabuse.org/what-we-do/)"

>Legal scholars said Judge Barrett’s opinions on the appeals court have been models of judicial craftsmanship, tightly reasoned and unflashy.  
>  
>“Her conservatism is embedded in her methodological and jurisprudential commitments, not any commitment to a particular policy outcome,” said Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. “As a scholar and a judge, she has shown herself to be a very careful and deliberate thinker who is concerned with getting the right answer, whether or not it’s the popular answer.”

&#x200B;

>Still, those who know Judge Barrett say she is not ideological in her writings. Every Notre Dame Law School faculty member supported her elevation to the appellate court, noting they did so in spite of their different political persuasions. One of her former students [said](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/scotus-candidate-judge-amy-coney-barrett-wasnt-my-favorite-law-professor-but-she-would-be-an-amazing-justice/) that in class she would not have known Ms. Barrett was Catholic, and that she did not start class with prayer or the sign of the cross like other professors at Notre Dame.

&#x200B;

>Peers describe her as a textualist like Justice Scalia: one who interprets the law based on its plain words, as opposed to someone who looks to accomplish the legislature’s purpose. And they said she was an originalist, meaning a judge who interprets the Constitution according to the understanding of those who drafted and ratified it.  
>  
>“Justice Kennedy showed a willingness to interpolate things into the Constitution that, in cases like Obergefell, that Justice Scalia for example would not have done,” said John Garvey, the president of the Catholic University of America, who taught Judge Barrett in law school, referring to the [2015 decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html) that established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. “My guess is that Judge Barrett wouldn’t assume that the judicial role carried that much power with it.”

&#x200B;

>In a 2017 [law review article](https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2330&context=law_faculty_scholarship) written before she joined the appeals court, Judge Barrett was critical of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s 2012 opinion sustaining a central provision of the Affordable Care Act, saying he had betrayed the commands of textualism. “Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute,” she wrote.

&#x200B;

>In the world of conservative judges, she has particularly strong credentials. Judge Barrett began clerking for Justice Antonin Scalia 22 years ago, and her fellow clerks are quick to say she was his favorite. She graduated summa cum laude from Notre Dame Law School and joined the faculty in 2002, earning praise from colleagues as an astute scholar and jurist even if they did not always agree on her jurisprudential premises.

>Legal scholars said Judge Barrett’s opinions on the appeals court have been models of judicial craftsmanship, tightly reasoned and unflashy.  
>  
>“Her conservatism is embedded in her methodological and jurisprudential commitments, not any commitment to a particular policy outcome,” said Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. “As a scholar and a judge, she has shown herself to be a very careful and deliberate thinker who is concerned with getting the right answer, whether or not it’s the popular answer.”

&#x200B;

>Still, those who know Judge Barrett say she is not ideological in her writings. Every Notre Dame Law School faculty member supported her elevation to the appellate court, noting they did so in spite of their different political persuasions. One of her former students [said](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/scotus-candidate-judge-amy-coney-barrett-wasnt-my-favorite-law-professor-but-she-would-be-an-amazing-justice/) that in class she would not have known Ms. Barrett was Catholic, and that she did not start class with prayer or the sign of the cross like other professors at Notre Dame.

&#x200B;

>Peers describe her as a textualist like Justice Scalia: one who interprets the law based on its plain words, as opposed to someone who looks to accomplish the legislature’s purpose. And they said she was an originalist, meaning a judge who interprets the Constitution according to the understanding of those who drafted and ratified it.  
>  
>“Justice Kennedy showed a willingness to interpolate things into the Constitution that, in cases like Obergefell, that Justice Scalia for example would not have done,” said John Garvey, the president of the Catholic University of America, who taught Judge Barrett in law school, referring to the [2015 decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html) that established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. “My guess is that Judge Barrett wouldn’t assume that the judicial role carried that much power with it.”

&#x200B;

>In a 2017 [law review article](https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2330&context=law_faculty_scholarship) written before she joined the appeals court, Judge Barrett was critical of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s 2012 opinion sustaining a central provision of the Affordable Care Act, saying he had betrayed the commands of textualism. “Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute,” she wrote.

&#x200B;

>In the world of conservative judges, she has particularly strong credentials. Judge Barrett began clerking for Justice Antonin Scalia 22 years ago, and her fellow clerks are quick to say she was his favorite. She graduated summa cum laude from Notre Dame Law School and joined the faculty in 2002, earning praise from colleagues as an astute scholar and jurist even if they did not always agree on her jurisprudential premises.

>Reducing the Federal Debt

>Our national debt is a burden on our economy 
and families. The huge increase in the national 
debt demanded by and incurred during the current 
Administration has placed a significant burden on 
future generations. We must impose firm caps on 
future debt, accelerate the repayment of the trillions 
we now owe in order to reaffirm our principles of 
responsible and limited government, and remove 
the burdens we are placing on future generations. 
A strong economy is one key to debt reduction, 
but spending restraint is a necessary component 
that must be vigorously pursued."

""From an excerpt of the book published in The Atlantic:

Chris DeSalvo’s reaction to the iPhone was immediate and visceral. “As a consumer I was blown away. I wanted one immediately. But as a Google engineer, I thought ‘We’re going to have to start over.’”

“What we had suddenly looked just so . . . nineties,” DeSalvo said. “It’s just one of those things that are obvious when you see it.”

Former Android chief, Andy Rubin’s reaction to the iPhone keynote was similar:

Rubin was so astonished by what Jobs was unveiling that, on his way to a meeting, he had his driver pull over so that he could finish watching the webcast.

"Cognitive dissonance is the term psychologists use to describe the mental debility that occurs when a person simultaneously holds two contradictory beliefs. Unfortunately, the Trump administration’s efforts to secure our borders and enforce immigration law seem to have generated a significant amount of cognitive dissonance, particularly among open borders advocates and the media.  Here’s a (by no means exhaustive) list of some of the mass migration arguments that rest on internal contradictions:

**It’s not fair to uproot illegal alien children and send them to a country they know nothing about:** Then, by definition, the parents of these illegal alien children were patently unfair when they first brought their kids to the United States, a country that they knew nothing about.  None of the proponents of this argument ever seem able to explain why enforcing immigration law creates a moral and ethical dilemma but violating it doesn’t.

**You’re separating families:** Every day in the United States, our courts send people with families to prison because they broke the law. Those people are separated from their families, sometimes for life. Yet no one ever advances the argument that we shouldn’t jail burglars, fraudsters or other law-breakers because they’ll be separated from their kin. It is a generally accepted principle that decisions to violate the law carry consequences. How is immigration law any different? It is illogical to argue that when immigrants consciously decide to separate their families in order to come to the United States, that’s okay; but that when the United States enforces immigration laws, the separation of families is immoral.  (It is also illogical to argue that the mere existence of innocent family members erases the illegal alien’s violation. No one gets a pass on drunk driving simply because the car was full of sober passengers.)

**So many illegal aliens have been here so long they have deep roots, it wouldn’t be right to send them away:** In no other area of the law does anyone argue that evading the police and continuously violating the law is a mitigating circumstance.  In fact, it’s usually considered an aggravating factor that results in a stiffer sentence. Yet open borders advocates consistently argue that the longer illegal aliens violate the law, the more lenient we should be with them. That’s a losing argument. As every parent and elementary school teacher knows, rewarding bad behavior simply leads to more bad behavior.

**Sure, illegal aliens broke immigration laws, but they’re obeying all of the other laws:** Typically, this is true of most people who perpetrate low-level crimes. But no one claims we shouldn’t punish tax evaders because they’re not murderers. It is what illegal aliens have done – violating the Immigration and Nationality Act – that should concern us, not what they didn’t do.

The bulk of the American people experience no cognitive dissonance when it comes to immigration. They understand that laws are enacted to protect public safety and national security. Therefore, engaging in mental gymnastics to avoid holding violators accountable is not in their best interests. The immigration enforcement challenge for the Trump administration will be to keep a clear head and not succumb to the defective thinking advanced by open borders advocates and their media cronies."
">The Democrats have ditched their mild-mannered, blue-collar, ""can't we all just get along"" façade for in-your-face ""give us what we want now"" socialist revolution at any cost.  They've gone all in on a Green New Deal that gives government bureaucrats control of the economy and the power to turn 2020s Chinese quarantine into a permanent state of affairs.  They've declared the same carbon dioxide we all exhale a national health emergency, not at all different from COVID-19.  They've declared systemic white supremacy and patriarchy health emergencies, too.  They've declared that math is racist, that police forces must be abolished, and that abortions must be permitted after childbirth.  They've unleashed an army of Antifa and BLM insurgents to intimidate Americans through mayhem and violence, and they accuse shocked observers who object to having their businesses looted and burned to the ground of being unreasonable bigots.  

>When the Democrats aren't toppling statues of American heroes or preparing to pack the Supreme Court with comrade communists certain to find the Constitution unconstitutional, they are actively censoring free speech, using the criminal justice system to persecute their foes, and threatening to kill conservatives one by one.  The Democrats may enforce mask mandates like the little authoritarians they are, but they've let their own political masks slip for good.  **Gone are the days when they were willing to pretend to be part of a peaceful and American political party, loyal to the Constitution and laws of the land.  They are an insurrectionist force now, intent on destroying the America that exists today through any means necessary.**

> Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton today filed a lawsuit against Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the United States Supreme Court.

The battleground states flooded their people with unlawful ballot applications and ballots while ignoring statutory requirements as to how they were received, evaluated and counted.

The cheaters have to be stopped.  

> Disenfranchisement occurs when people are deprived of the right to vote. No one was deprived here. What Trump is doing, with his request that every legal vote count, is asking that courts invalidate illegal votes. **You cannot disenfranchise an illegal voter, whether that “voter” is dead, a computer algorithm, or a form filled out in a Chinese print shop.**

>Do you know what happens when you invalidate fraudulent votes and count only legal votes? You identify the winner and loser in an election, as has happened in America since 1792. Those who voted for the losing candidate were not disenfranchised; they just voted for the losing candidate.

Count the legal votes, and don’t count the illegal votes.

In 1932, the Depression caused the Rosenwald Fund to end the control program, as it could no longer afford the cost. Dr. Taliaferro Clark, the Public Health Service advisor to the Rosenwald Fund, decided to continue for another six months to a year. He then wanted to treat the participants and end the study. Clark retired in June 1932 and his successor, Dr. Raymond Vonderlehr, decided to continue the Study to the death of all participants. 

The PHS' rationale was that studying syphilis' long-term progression in black men would complement a 1910 Norwegian Study which did the same thing in whites, as well as give some indication of treatment's efficacy."

Replace loveseat with a chair. (Edit: dark leather would contrast nicely or a patterned fabric)

Mount tv above fireplace if possible, run electrical to fireplace mounting

Can’t tell if fireplace is symmetrical. Consider bookshelves on either side of it. Will help frame TV and help with cords. Consider ikea for this if you just want to buy something cheap and “easy”. 

Try getting some color in there somehow. Some throw pillows on the couches. A nice rug perhaps. Or replace coffee table with a patterned footrest. Get some curtains with some pattern and color too. Find one thing you love (pillows, rug, curtains, throw blanket etc...) and start from there. Tie in everything to that one piece with out repeating to much colors or patters. Try walking around a home furnishing store, or department store for these small pieces. 

Maybe replace the gold part of the fireplace. Dont really know your options here without knowing more about it. 

Hard to say what floors would be good there without knowing what is in the rest of the house. If the carpet is just confined to that area you can replace that without to much cost

The Chinese Communist Party desires to exercise complete control over the Chinese citizenry, their speech, their religion, their economic activities, and over everything they say, do, or think every minute of the day.

"Given my limited knowledge of Star Wars....I am going to say that it'll be an intense fight, but I think that Stitch wins most fights.

**However** I think more Jedi's will survive Order 626 because a few Jedi's will accidentally find his weakness to water. You'll also have some intense Jedi battles using whatever force thing they can do, but in the end Stitch wins. ~~Also does anyone know if Stitch is weak to snow? Since it's water?~~ Uh Anyways.... [It is believed that under 1% of the Jedi's survived order 66](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/40252/how-many-jedi-were-there-at-the-time-of-the-purge), but with Order 626 I am going to make a random estimate of 10-25% surviving (or possibly even higher). With this they can share the knowledge with other Jedi about Stitches weakness and overcome any Stitches they encounter. So with more Jedi's left, the Empire have a lot stronger Rebellion to deal with due to having a strong number of Jedi's joining them.

TL;DR -- Stitches will win, but Jedi's from order 626 have a higher survival rate than those of Order 66.  


EDIT: As some have corrected me, Stitch weakness is actually that he is very dense, not that he is weak to water. So a random Jedi might have some luck to push him in the lake and win, but that's by chance so I am going to stick to my theory of the survival rate just being higher."

"Fuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you’re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It’s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind’s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who’s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in."

We loaded in custom maps of slide paths onto the 66i and it’s pretty helpful. I also use a Garmin watch so it’s a nice bit of synergy. If there’s a line that I skied that I want to mark I can save the location on my watch and it’ll pop up on my 66i. I’ve used it with gloves on and gloves off and it’s easy to use. That is another major plus when compared to a phone. You don’t have to take your gloves off to use it. I’ve used it in blizzard conditions and it has been fine.

"I grew up always having declawed cats in the house. I thought it was normal and that the cats didn’t care once healed. So, unfortunately, I had my first cat declawed. At the time I didn’t know how it actually affects them and my vet at the time didn’t inform me either. I feel awful about it after I learned what declawing actually does to a cat. My cat has adjusted to it as good as she could have. It’s been 8 years since and I still wish I hadn’t done it. Never again. 

P.s: I now use a different vet. A cat only vet who actively advocates against declawing. I think they’ll still do it for an owner who insists but I they fully describe what it does to the cat first. Also, when they do declaw, I know they use a surgical laser instead of traditional methods. Still not good but better than the old methods."

I don't hear this talked about much, but wouldn't the passengers have heard the hijackers killing all the flight crew in the cockpit and realize they needed to try something? Even if they didn't realize the hijackers were on a suicide mission, they should have at least realized they probably can't land the plane.

100%.. every article covering this makes sure to bury the “whites not allowed” aspect down in the middle of the article.

"As female who has been the exact same person you’re describing, I can tell you that you’re absolutely correct. That being said, the guy who played your role, he was very damn stubborn. We did the friend dance but there was always something more there. He dated elsewhere while I kept doing the unavailable thing. It took about 2-3 years but he was always willing to try. I took myself to therapy. He was the first person I decided I wanted to actually give myself to completely after I’d gotten some counseling under my belt. There’s been a few hiccups but it’s been the best relationship of my life. We were friends more than anything. I KNEW he cared for me as more than just the label he wished we had and he never gave up on me. This helped me build trust for him and us because I learned that when he told me, things like “I’ll never love someone like I love you”.: well, after 3 years of patience and seeing him just show up.. fix a wall when I drive my car into it. Lol visit me on my lunch break one day because I’d had a rough shift.. cooking a special plate that I like at our friends pot luck gatherings because I’m allergic to everything else lol. Even while he was dating others and traveling etc.. he showed me that he meant what he said. Had he just bailed because I couldn’t give him exactly what he wanted, the way and how he wanted, I’d think he was very selfish and feel like I dodged a bullet.

If there really is a connection and you know there are legitimate issues for her emotional unavailability, consider being patient. Guard your heart, distance yourself and carry on with your life but don’t abandon her. Not if you truly care for her. I know I put my boyfriend through some pain (trust me I was in pain too because I didn’t like having feelings and caring for him, yet not being able to jump in and not being able to control it) but he never gave up on me and said he always felt there was something in me deep down that wanted it too. We had a large circle of mutual friends so that helped us to stay in contact I guess. 

Bottom line, protect your heart, DONT SLEEP WITH HER, don’t even try to date her. Be her friend after taking a little time for yourself. Get out there and date. Be honest with her. Encourage her to work on her issues. You never know what the future may bring. “You can’t yank on a flower and expect it to grow”.."
"Yes!! I used to stand in the mirror and cry my eyes out! How much I hated that bag and hated looking at it and how awful my life was going to be having been forced to have it. It took me a few months but I started to realize that without the bag, I wouldn’t have been able to stand in the mirror and cry at all. It’s hard to wrap your head around hating and being so embarrassed about something that literally saved your life. I ended up having a successful reversal about two months after I became an ostomy pro that had fully embraced it for what it was.

"My ex husband, who I caught and only now in retrospect know was porn addiction, he turned it around and attacked my appearance. I had just given birth to our son via c-section 3 months prior. He started using that as an excuse for all of his wandering eye, porn and masturbation use and withholding if sex etc.. mind you, the person I ultimately caught him having an affair with was twice my size.. 

As for my current partner, the porn problem is a brand new discovery. He says it is for him as well because he didn’t think it was really an addiction or the cause of his sexual dysfunctions etc. either way, he sought help immediately and has been seeking help for us together as well as a sex therapist. He spends every day trying to convince me that it has nothing to do with me, that I’m physically everything he desires and have always been his ultimate goal etc.. We gone hours about this problem. I’ve cried and questioned etc. he hasn’t wavered or made an excuse about it being my appearance. We have discussed his childhood, decades long conditioning, lack of intimate touch etc as being the reasons.."
Porn is not safe. ESPECIALLY when it comes to “teen”. You are skating a line. You are hoping for the legality of a birthday but understand that looks can indicate something different? That’s not even touching on the major sex trafficking issue going on. You may not have to worry so much about the trafficking issue but I would really question myself if I was this concerned about the age demographic I was drawn to for porn.
Men don’t need or seek closure. It’s nothing more than an opportunity for them to get a foot in the door to sleep with you again.. Especially when you’re in such a vulnerable place. Closure comes from yourself.

Truly loving a person is loving them above everything. It’s our ego that gets in the way a lot.

"The term “emnetwiht” actually derives from Old English, and etymologically is related to the term “barrowwiht” or “barrow wight”. “Barrow” and “Emnet” are actually opposites, meaning mound and a level plain, respectively. This is interesting since the official page lists both emnetwiht **and** barrowwiht as [races](http://sukasuka-anime.com/chara/souwong.html).

Both terms were used by [Tolkien](http://oldewyrd.blogspot.com/):

>And in the first book of The Lord of the Rings, the hobbits encounter a barrow-wight, a supernatural being that guards the treasure in a barrow or grave. The term was actually coined in the 19th century by Andrew Lang, a writer about myths and legends. It is a compounding of barrow and wight, an Old English term for a living creature, especially a human. This sense long ago fell out of use. Wight also has had a sense of a supernatural being since c. 950. This second sense also fell out of general use, although writers, like Lang and Tolkien, have made occasional use of it over the centuries to evoke an archaic atmosphere.

>A barrow is a mound of earth and stones erected over a grave. Originally from an Old English word for mountain, that sense has long passed out of the language, except in the names of particular hills. The term survived as a local term for a grave mound in the Southwest of England. It since has enjoyed a revival as an archeological term. Tolkien uses it the sense of a grave mound, especially those found just outside the borders of the Shire.

Further:

>Place names in Rohan are also from Old English. The capital is Edoras, or the courts, and the king’s hall is Meduseld, or mead-hall. Districts in Rohan are Eastemnet and Westemnet, from the Old English emnet meaning plain or level ground.

"Rapper Lil Wayne was charged Tuesday in Florida with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a federal offense that carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years in prison.

Documents filed in Miami federal court say the rapper, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., had a gun and ammunition on Dec. 23 of last year despite knowing he had the previous felony on his record.

Authorities said the 38-year-old rapper acknowledged owning the gold-plated handgun after his luggage was searched upon arriving in Miami on a private plane. A search warrant, first reported by the Miami Herald at the time, said Carter told investigators the gun was a Father’s Day gift.

Carter’s attorney, Howard Srebnick, said in an email that there are legal questions about whether mere possession of a weapon by a felon not judged to be dangerous fits the definition of a crime.

“Carter is charged with possessing a gold-plated handgun in his luggage on a private plane. There is no allegation that he ever fired it, brandished it, used it or threatened to use it,” Srebnick said. “There is no allegation that he is a dangerous person.”

Investigators also reported finding suspected illegal drugs in the luggage, but Carter has not been charged with a drug offense.

An initial court date on the weapons charge is set for Dec. 11 in Miami federal court.

The charge stems from a weapons conviction of Carter in New York more than a decade ago, for which he was sentenced to eight months in prison. Convicted felons are barred under federal law from owning firearms.

As Lil Wayne, Carter has sold over 120 million records, has won five Grammys and numerous other music awards. He owns a home in Miami Beach and is CEO of his own record label, Young Money Entertainment."

Where android is Java.

EDIT: not to mention when you’re making an app, They have simulators for every major IPhone/android that you can think of to test and run your code. Those simulators can almost be laughed at.

"Rapper Lil Wayne was charged Tuesday in Florida with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a federal offense that carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years in prison.

Documents filed in Miami federal court say the rapper, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., had a gun and ammunition on Dec. 23 of last year despite knowing he had the previous felony on his record.

Authorities said the 38-year-old rapper acknowledged owning the gold-plated handgun after his luggage was searched upon arriving in Miami on a private plane. A search warrant, first reported by the Miami Herald at the time, said Carter told investigators the gun was a Father’s Day gift.

Carter’s attorney, Howard Srebnick, said in an email that there are legal questions about whether mere possession of a weapon by a felon not judged to be dangerous fits the definition of a crime.

“Carter is charged with possessing a gold-plated handgun in his luggage on a private plane. There is no allegation that he ever fired it, brandished it, used it or threatened to use it,” Srebnick said. “There is no allegation that he is a dangerous person.”

Investigators also reported finding suspected illegal drugs in the luggage, but Carter has not been charged with a drug offense.

An initial court date on the weapons charge is set for Dec. 11 in Miami federal court.

The charge stems from a weapons conviction of Carter in New York more than a decade ago, for which he was sentenced to eight months in prison. Convicted felons are barred under federal law from owning firearms.

As Lil Wayne, Carter has sold over 120 million records, has won five Grammys and numerous other music awards. He owns a home in Miami Beach and is CEO of his own record label, Young Money Entertainment."

Gab is pretty big, but has a big problem with it's reputation. It seems to have turned into a very very christian social site. It is also very unmoderated, which means there is a lot of content that turns normal center/center right people off.

Retalk is more like Reddit or facebook groups. We are trying to build communities that anyone can enjoy and participate it. It's grassroots communities. I really hope that even without big republican/right wing names we can still build a really good product."

I am also following the whole woke movement quite closely, mostly to my horror, and somehow this all came together to starting Retalk, which brings all of these together.

"Left my previous employer in December of 2020. My current employer is a competitor. Same business and I was going to a very similar role, but receiving a 40% increase. When I gave the notice to my manager, he said that if I was going to a competitor and if I wanted to disclose the position and offer I'd accepted, he could take it to management to see if they would counter. Keep in mind the department had been bleeding employees, half the department was a year or less in tenure, and shortly after I started in that role they raised the starting rate for the position but didn't extend it to those who were making less, but wanted us to mentor the new employees. So I responded to him, ""Ok I highly doubt they'll match or make a better offer, but the role I accepted is _______ at ________ and the salary offer was _________. He said okay I'll let you know. Less than 2 hours later I got an email from him letting me know that management would not be able to match, and declined to even make a counter offer.

"I previously worked at Walmart. I'm a dude and not small but my job and what I got paid to do was cashier. Was approached by one assistant manager one night and was removed from the cash register and sent to the back to unload a truck because no one showed from the unloading team. I get back there and it's all middle aged women, also plucked from other departments, so guess who got on the truck? 

The truck looked like it was loaded by a hurricane. Eventually I pulled the wrong box and started an avalanche. This was before flat screens were on every tv, and a 30 inch CRT TV rolled down the mountain and hit me in the shoulder. About ten minutes later I notice my arm going numb and it progressively gets worse. Decide to report it and a second assistant manager tried to get me to leave and go to the hospital. I told him I already knew that I had to go to the Walmart approved doctor, otherwise any potential workers comp would be void. So the next day I go to their approved Dr, who said most likely a pinched nerve and swelling. She trusted me to stay off my arm but didn't trust Walmart to let me, so she gave me a soft arm sling and a note to take to Walmart saying I shouldn't lift anything with my left arm for two weeks. They made me work door greeter rather than give me workers compensation, but that was fine.

Later the same manager who tried to trick me into going to the wrong Dr asked me to stay over and help set up school supplies for back to school. I said I would, but only if it was extra hours and that I wouldn't have hours cut the next day which was the last day of the schedule. He said yes so I stayed. Sure enough I got sent home the next day.

"I got my Pfizer shots back in the early Spring, back when you had to work hard to find somewhere with available vaccines. 

I much prefer getting the shot to getting the Covid.

Edit: There are 168,000,000 vaccinated people in the US. There have been 9,716 breakthrough cases that involved hospitalization or death. 

So, 168 million, less than 10k breakthroughs 

If you have the vaccine you’re not at risk of getting seriously sick with Covid. If you catch it after vaccination it’s 99%-100% chance you’ll have a cold and that’s it."

You did literally every step personal finance recommends and they are attacking you for it. You got outside help when you could, you stayed at home actually a lot less than you should have (3 months after college is somehow unreasonable now?). You negotiated pay raises and changed jobs as needed. You made a proper budget. You cut every corner you reasonably could.

The problem these people have? You didn't make excuses and used every advantage you possibly could. Your advantages were less than your average redditor. Think about it: The average US redditor is a college aged white kid from New York or California according to reddits own data. These are opulent areas and its very safe to assume they have parental help - likely much more so than yours as they are in insanely over priced areas.

This is their way of shutting down the photosynthesis process for the winter and just live off the food stored.

"NAL but am a dispatcher and Assistant Terminal Agency Coordinator for my agency.  This is illegal and will result in consequences for both the dispatcher and the agency. NCIC (and your state's equivalent) is not a dating program.  It is also super easy to track as everything you do is  recorded.  What's more, there are some flags for abuse that alert security that someone might be doing something unacceptable.  

1) Contact the department, preferably when she's not working.  Ask to speak to the chief (if a smallish department) or the dispatch supervisor.  One of them will be the TAC for their agency.  Meet with them in person and file a complaint.

2) Contact the MA DCJIS offices.  Their number can be found here: https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-criminal-justice-information-services    I believe they manage the state databases as well as the state's access to NCIC.  Find out who handles complaints about abuse of these databases.


This isn't something that these agencies take lightly, nor do the police departments.  Penalties can range from hefty fines on the dispatcher as well as the agency, jail time (state dependent) for the dispatcher, and loss of access to the agency.  

 Looking back a couple elections, do you remember ""Joe the Plumber?""  He was some guy who asked Obama some hard questions while running for the Presidency.

So, if you need a couple days, they might be able to help you out.  If you want another month, you're out of luck."
"If she checked you through the state DMV computer, the state crime computer (whatever MA calls theirs), or NCIC, its logged.   She'd have a hard time proving she had cause to do it.  If it is through the Computer Aided Dispatch program it almost definitely logs every tiny thing she does and is again, easily traceable.  If it was through the department's police report program, it most likely has an audit function of some sort.  Using the CAD/Reporting system for personal use is going to be against policy in any agency and probably illegal, although I'm not familiar with your state.

It could be possible I suppose that she checked those online background check/detective sites.

"The issue for most of us isn't leaving.  We can't be there forever.  However, packing up and bugging out without a gradual exit plan is what gave us ISIS.  Leaving doesn't do us any good if we have to turn around and go back in a year or two later to stop another terror group or slaughter. Copying Obama's mistakes isn't the smart thing to do.

Second, many have issue with the message that this sends to allies.  During Desert Storm we told the Kurds to rise up and that we'd back them.  They trusted us and did as we asked.  We promptly abandoned them and they slaughtered by Saddam.  Then, we decide to go back into Iraq and again ask them for help.  Thinking we mean business, they ally with us again and fight diligently alongside us.  Now, we're abandoning them again.   They're surrounded by the Iranians, Syrians, and Turks, all who would happily line up every Kurdish man, woman, and child, shoot them, and leave them in a mass grave.  

Eventually we're going to need to deploy troops again, somewhere in the world.  Wherever it is, we'll need allies.   Who on Earth would be stupid enough to ally with the US knowing that if it becomes even mildly politically inconvenient, we'll leave them to be mass murdered?   Why not ally with Russia or China instead and refuse to help us at every single step possible?

As for Israel, they are the only stable ally we have in the region.  Why shouldn't we support them?  Does anyone actually think we can just go it alone and have no friends or allies?  Even if you do arrogantly think that is possible, it still doesn't make sense.   Our alliance with Israel has in some cases allowed us to force restraint on their part and in others to make their neighbors think twice about attacking them.  While this might not matter to some people, if such a war were to happen and should Israel start to lose, they have nuclear weapons.  If pressed to use them you can kiss a large portion of the world's oil supplies goodbye for years.  This would hurt us a great deal, and I'm not just talking about gas and oil prices.  Even if we were fully energy independent, the rest of the world isn't, and the rest of the world buys American goods.  If they suddenly are going through economic crises due to fuel shortages, it would hurt us a great deal.  

Stability in the region matters for us on many levels.  If we're going to pull out we need to do it gradually and with a solid exit strategy.  We need to ensure that stability continues and that a premature exit doesn't cause more problems than it solves.  Mattis and other national security experts know this.  Trump doesn't seem to.  

tl;dr - Copying Obama's playbook is only going to cause us more problems in the long run.

Yes.  Burning buildings is not protesting though.  Attacking firefighters is not protesting.  Breaking into stores and stealing things is not protesting.  Using lasers to blind news pilots and police on rooftops is not protesting.   Blocking ambulances from helping people is not protesting.  Cutting gas lines to create an explosion is not protesting.  Assaulting people is not protesting.

>How is this not government overstepping boundaries? Don't most conservatives believe in small government?

The government fired the officers and will pursue charges.  Police elsewhere have roundly condemned what happened here.  The local mayor has sided with protesters (not rioters) and will go after the cops.  The system is working.  It would have worked sooner but failed Democrat presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar chose to let the main officer in this tragedy get away with all sorts of stuff by declining to prosecute him in the past.

>Do you really think police opening fire on civilians (once the looting starts, the shooting starts) is really the solution? Wasn't this all started because of policemen wrongfully killing civilians?

No.  It doesn't solve anything and would only make things worse as many of the rioters are armed as well.  I don't believe the President's Tweets are helpful.  In fact I believe they are harmful.   As for the National Guard being there, the reality is they do even less than the police in these sorts of situations.  They're not going to be running around shooting people no matter what Trump or those upset at him think."

"Hi,

I'm a previous suicide hotline volunteer in the UK, I ceased to be one around 12 months ago because of stress and my own mental health making me less confident of my ability to help people when I was myself in a fragile state. I fully believe everything you've been saying: in the UK all of the hotlines I know of aim to get someone to answer within 3 rings however that's not always possible; I always hated knowing that someone was waiting and there was nothing I can do, but that's about a lack of recruitment and not because the person on the other end just doesn't care. One thing I've heard however at least with some American hotlines is that when they receive a call they might contact the police if they think someone is in immediate danger of suicide. I have always been taught not to do this and besides I have no way of knowing where the caller is unless they tell me, however it seems like a really strange thing to do. Is this something that actually happens, if so why?"

"I have a law degree, so I've had to look up British law very often during my studies and it is very easy to find. It is however not the easiest thing to read, and I feel this does need to be rectified in some way.

The issue is that in a common law legal system at least judges are regularly required to interpret the law and decide on parliamentary intention when making judgements: obviously the first text they will refer to in that instance is the statute law in question. Therefore, parliamentarians have a vested interest in making the law extremely specific and fiddly in order to give the least possible amount of wiggle room when it comes to interpretation. Obviously this has the unintended side effect of making the law difficult for many people to understand, leading to increased ignorance. To rectify this I believe the best course of action is to create and properly fund a free information service which carefully spells out the provisions of the law in an easy to follow way, so there isn't a massive amount of statute reading people who haven't been trained to read laws need to do.

Of course, there are many areas of law where this would be extremely difficult either to write or to codify. Tax law for instance is one where it would be hard to create an easy read version: it's an absolute trap for the unwary traveler and a lot of perfectly good lawyers want absolutely nothing to do with it for that reason. You really do need a lawyer who specialises in tax law. Another area where it would be difficult is the part of law written almost exclusively by judges, in which it really can be hard to find the court case that backs up your point (or destroys it) if the violation is a really fiddly/ancient one."

>Legal scholars said Judge Barrett’s opinions on the appeals court have been models of judicial craftsmanship, tightly reasoned and unflashy.  
>  
>“Her conservatism is embedded in her methodological and jurisprudential commitments, not any commitment to a particular policy outcome,” said Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. “As a scholar and a judge, she has shown herself to be a very careful and deliberate thinker who is concerned with getting the right answer, whether or not it’s the popular answer.”

&#x200B;

>Still, those who know Judge Barrett say she is not ideological in her writings. Every Notre Dame Law School faculty member supported her elevation to the appellate court, noting they did so in spite of their different political persuasions. One of her former students [said](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/scotus-candidate-judge-amy-coney-barrett-wasnt-my-favorite-law-professor-but-she-would-be-an-amazing-justice/) that in class she would not have known Ms. Barrett was Catholic, and that she did not start class with prayer or the sign of the cross like other professors at Notre Dame.

&#x200B;

>Peers describe her as a textualist like Justice Scalia: one who interprets the law based on its plain words, as opposed to someone who looks to accomplish the legislature’s purpose. And they said she was an originalist, meaning a judge who interprets the Constitution according to the understanding of those who drafted and ratified it.  
>  
>“Justice Kennedy showed a willingness to interpolate things into the Constitution that, in cases like Obergefell, that Justice Scalia for example would not have done,” said John Garvey, the president of the Catholic University of America, who taught Judge Barrett in law school, referring to the [2015 decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html) that established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. “My guess is that Judge Barrett wouldn’t assume that the judicial role carried that much power with it.”

&#x200B;

>In a 2017 [law review article](https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2330&context=law_faculty_scholarship) written before she joined the appeals court, Judge Barrett was critical of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s 2012 opinion sustaining a central provision of the Affordable Care Act, saying he had betrayed the commands of textualism. “Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute,” she wrote.

&#x200B;

>In the world of conservative judges, she has particularly strong credentials. Judge Barrett began clerking for Justice Antonin Scalia 22 years ago, and her fellow clerks are quick to say she was his favorite. She graduated summa cum laude from Notre Dame Law School and joined the faculty in 2002, earning praise from colleagues as an astute scholar and jurist even if they did not always agree on her jurisprudential premises.

Rather, anorexia is diagnosed as a psychiatric disorder and treated appropriately with psychotherapy.

>Our national debt is a burden on our economy 
and families. The huge increase in the national 
debt demanded by and incurred during the current 
Administration has placed a significant burden on 
future generations. We must impose firm caps on 
future debt, accelerate the repayment of the trillions 
we now owe in order to reaffirm our principles of 
responsible and limited government, and remove 
the burdens we are placing on future generations. 
A strong economy is one key to debt reduction, 
but spending restraint is a necessary component 
that must be vigorously pursued."

*Is this greasy mode?*
"There is a whole field of study (theodicy) devoted to answering these questions, so if you want answers, there is plenty to find. That being said, if you just want my personal take on it, it comes down to a question of *optimization*.  

To question God’s morality vis a vis the existence of evil is to fundamentally accuse God of poor design. Essentially, you are saying that the system is *suboptimal*.  By necessity, you need to define the *optima* to be able to determine if a system is, in fact, suboptimal. It would seem that you are trying to establish an optima based off of some kind of moral good. How can this be measured?  Let’s say by whether or not it minimizes suffering. If this were the case, then as you pointed out, the system is suboptimal. In fact, if God had made us all plants, we would never know suffering. So, would the world be a better place if we were all just mindless plants?  It doesn’t seem so. Why not?  Well, there is a lot of good in this world that comes from the fact that we have minds and can form relationships. So, perhaps the existence of *love* could be an optima. 

As it happens, when optimizing a system, you can and often do have to consider multiple optima. An airplane is clearly inferior to a tank, if the only consideration is durability. But if we also want to optimize for being light enough to fly, fuel efficiency (as a function of weight, aerodynamics, etc.), carrying capacity, etc., a Boeing 747 is better optimized than an Abrams. Is it better than a B52, though?  Well, that is an issue of which of the *competing optima* are prioritized over others. For military applications, durability and being able to withstand small arms fire are going to be a bigger priority than in commercial applications. Likewise, cargo capacity is a higher priority relative to passenger capacity, if you want to drop a bunch of bombs. Which optima are higher or lower in priority are dependent on the *intended function* or purpose. 

So we have to determine the multiple competing optima for the world we live in, and their priority relative to the purpose for the existence of the world. We have to know why we are here. Do you know that?  Because that is one of the greatest mysteries of the ages, so if you have that figured out, you should probably share with the rest of the class. I don’t claim to have it all figured out, but I know it isn’t simply to exist in the absence of suffering. If God wanted that, He would have just made a garden. He didn’t just make a garden; He also made Adam and Eve. What is the purpose of humanity?  Well, in the same way that we could say that we wouldn’t be better off as plants because we would never experience love, could we not consider love as an optima for the creation of the world?  What would that look like?  How do you optimize for love?  What does it require?  In the same way that an airplane can’t achieve flight without sufficient lift generated by the wings to offset the weight, love requires *free will*.  Noone ever loved anybody involuntarily. 

So how do we optimize for free will?  An old quote from Henry ford when they first started mass production of the model T was something to the effect of, “you can have any color you want, so long as it’s black.”  The joke being that if you restrict all the choices down to one, then it is no longer a choice. We can’t love unless we are given the option not to love. Likewise, we can’t actually do good (or, at least, it is no credit to us) unless we have the option to do evil. Free will is “baked into the cake,” so to speak. Without it, we could never love eachother, or God. 

What does having *actual* free will look like?  How much freedom does it take to really be free?  Often, we look at cultures with arranged marriages and criticize them for not having “*true love*.”  If you are technically free to marry whoever you want, but there is just this one person that your parents arranged for you to marry, and society expects you to marry that person, and almost everybody else that you could possibly marry is already betrothed to their arranged marriage, so you choose to go along with your arranged marriage, was that really your own choice?  Likewise, consider if God was visibly, physically omnipresent. He automatically smites anyone who does any evil, and you have the “choice” of whether to love Him and follow Him, or...it really isn’t much of a choice. Logically, noone would ever be able to choose not to follow. You know how people feel awkward at work when their boss is there working with them, and they feel like they are constantly being scrutinized, and it is really stressful?  Imagine that turned up to eleven. Is that the kind of world that would be properly optimized for God’s purposes?  Not likely. So, we have to be totally free to commit unspeakable evils, and choose to do good instead. We have to be completely free to ignore God, and choose to love Him instead. That does open the door for a multitude of suffering, but that is what is necessary. And, as it happens, knowing God is far and away greater in magnitude than any amount of suffering, and lasts for an eternity, while all suffering is but a breath. 

Now you might criticize me or God Himself for taking lightly the suffering we endure for the sake of the opportunity to be in relationship with Him. Is He ignorant of our suffering? Does He know how we feel?  Does He even care?  Well, He gave up his only son to be brutally murdered, and in the person of Jesus, experienced that brutality first-hand. And He endured it all just to make a way for us to be redeemed and be able to be in relationship with Him. I would say He gets it."

"God Will Save Me

A terrible storm came into a town and local officials sent out an emergency warning that the riverbanks would soon overflow and flood the nearby homes. They ordered everyone in the town to evacuate immediately.

A faithful Christian man heard the warning and decided to stay, saying to himself, “I will trust God and if I am in danger, then God will send a divine miracle to save me.”

The neighbors came by his house and said to him, “We’re leaving and there is room for you in our car, please come with us!” But the man declined. “I have faith that God will save me.”

As the man stood on his porch watching the water rise up the steps, a man in a canoe paddled by and called to him, “Hurry and come into my canoe, the waters are rising quickly!” But the man again said, “No thanks, God will save me.”

The floodwaters rose higher pouring water into his living room and the man had to retreat to the second floor. A police motorboat came by and saw him at the window. “We will come up and rescue you!” they shouted. But the man refused, waving them off saying, “Use your time to save someone else! I have faith that God will save me!”

The flood waters rose higher and higher and the man had to climb up to his rooftop.

A helicopter spotted him and dropped a rope ladder. A rescue officer came down the ladder and pleaded with the man, ""Grab my hand and I will pull you up!"" But the man STILL refused, folding his arms tightly to his body. “No thank you! God will save me!”

Shortly after, the house broke up and the floodwaters swept the man away and he drowned.

When in Heaven, the man stood before God and asked, “I put all of my faith in You. Why didn’t You come and save me?”

And God said, “Son, I sent you a warning. I sent you a car. I sent you a canoe. I sent you a motorboat. I sent you a helicopter. What more were you looking for?”"

"> In the “transformation-through-education” camps, life and death do not mean the same thing as they do elsewhere. A hundred times over I thought, when the footfalls of guards woke us in the night, that our time had come to be executed. When a hand viciously pushed clippers across my skull, and other hands snatched away the tufts of hair that fell on my shoulders, I shut my eyes, blurred with tears, thinking my end was near, that I was being readied for the scaffold, the electric chair, drowning. Death lurked in every corner. When the nurses grabbed my arm to “vaccinate” me, I thought they were poisoning me. In reality, they were sterilising us. That was when I understood the method of the camps, the strategy being implemented: not to kill us in cold blood, but to make us slowly disappear. So slowly that no one would notice.
